Wednesday Morning

Dear Mom:

Was sorry not to have heard from you this morning because if you are
really looking forward to my coming home this weekend, I could make it,
but if so, I wouldn't have enough money to last until the 15th. Didn't
save out quite enough this time for everyday expenses. Also, it seems
rather extnavagant to come up now and also the long weekend of Washing-
ton's Birthday. So unless I hear from you this evening or tomorrow
morning that you are really counting on it, I guess I will postpone the
trip until two weeks from now. I'm pretty sure we don't get a holiday
on the 12th.

I got a nice birthday letter from my brother last evening. He seems to
be enjoying his schooling as much as possible, anyway. His letter was
very interesting. However, I am in a quandry asto his address. On the
first letter I got from him it was "Co. I", and on this one, "Co. V".
Perhaps you can tell me which it is. He didn't mention having received
my letter, so maybe the first is wrong. Will use the "Co. V" when I
write to him next.
Must close now and mail this to you and will be seeing you at a later
date.

With love,
Julia
