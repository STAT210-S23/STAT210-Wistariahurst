Thursday Morning

Dear Mom:

This is just a quick note.

Thought I'd tell you that some really big news is going to break in the
Transcript tomorrow, Friday, night. I got advanced notice of it yesterday
and it nearly floored me. I won't tell you what it is and keep you in
suspense. Perhaps you have already heard. In any case, please do not
neglect to send me the notice of it this time.

Also, I wish you'd write more than just once a week. Thought surely I'd
get a letter this morning. Hope everything is all right.

I'm really planning to come up next weekend. Would come this weekend but
am expecting the curse so will take it easy.

Had dinner at Milbank last night with Hildegarde. Dottie & Eleanor weren't
home so we went to the movies - saw "In Which We Serve" - a war picture, too
graphic.

Tuesday night I went alone to "Gotterdamerung".. It was just grand.

My turn to get dinner tonight and tomorrow night. Found some lamb shops
in the market this morning. Sometimes I go up to the market after breakfast 
and before coming to work - the best time to go.

Another Barnard Club USO part is scheduled for Sunday night, which we will
probably go to.

Mr. Carter is going to work on his income tax tommorrow and I will type
it up. Some fun. I may have to stay and do it in the evening.

No more news for now. Be good.

Heaps of love,
Julia
