Tuesday
: Dear Mothers; ) 3
I guess you were ss surprised as any of us to see or rather hear
from Uncle Jack. As you perhaps know he called on Friday and arrived on
, Saturday. I met him and was with him Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday he stayed
- around Brooklyn and on Wednesday he left 5 Withris—car for the South,
ie presumably Fayetteville, S.C. He was in pretty good spirits and seemed in
, : good health, His future plans are unknown but I don't think he will bring
, the boat up here this summer. 7
On Sunday we went to Northport and spent some time on Rbbbies
boat. He was invited to stay during the week but would have to hunt around
3 during the week-end because of Robbies son and daughter-in-law, So I guess
he decided it was too crowded around these parts with all the babies etc.
so he left.
| I suppose you are getting ready for your trip. I hope the
weather-is nice &lthough we could use a little rain. We are planning
a to come up Friday after-noon. Ih pe to get started early but may not
eae zet away until about four. Please don't bother to have any special meal
~ 8s I don't want to bother you nor do we know exactly when we will arrive.
~*~ 2 Thanks for getting the crib. Everything else we will fnave with uS.
I don't know whether or not Julia will come up with us, She may have to
work later than when we start, The next day we are zoing up to duds
? so you wn't have us wmder-foot very much, Susan is growing every day
and crawls and mumbles all the time. She hasn't walked or talked yet
but we expect to be surprised any daye Maybe you will see her first
