Dear Mother,
Every thing is going very well
down here. The only thing wrong
is that I am working too hard!
I really don't have much time to do the things I would like to
wich is write, read, [????] etc. I am
on the go the entire day and
when the time comes for doing
the canteen, I am ready to do to
bed. However, the first month
will be the hardest. You see I
have complete charge of all the
hooks and most of the drying.
I dry sometimes as much as
$1200 worth of goods a day. Also
I have to get a system of

[???]keeping started. Once it is
established and running then I
won't have to work so hard. I
will have full time assistant
who I hope will take over the
[overtime?] work in the hooks.
Altogether I have ten men
[under?] my charge and it's [one?]
job to keep them all working.
The exchange (official name for
canteen) officer is very nice even
though he does no nothing about
[?].
Friday we are going to have an
official [?] and [?]
taking. All the hooks will be
[inherited?] and I must be on [?]
metal. So I get by and make a 
good showing then all will be
well. I only can say that this is
my first [?] and I

hope I have lived up to it.
There is a bit of news I will
tell you although it is a bit
[lengthy?]. I have been picked
(as [me?] of a group) to enlist in a
series of [?] to study to
become an officer. The only
hitch is that I haven't been in
the regiment long enough. My
application for study may be
turned down by the higher ups
even though my [?]
command has given his o.k.
I can only [?] and time will
tell.
The weather has been pretty
dismal recently - it rained for a
day and now the office area
is a [?] of mud. It is pretty
cold although it warms up &
about ? 5Â° in the [norm hours].
I have to stop now
as the canteen is closing and I
must clean things up and
see that all is in order.
Love,
Fred
P.S. Send my [?] as long
as possible. [????] [?] take
out [?] I will send you
the money (5.00 + or -). I don't
want to [lose?] it. The make is
$25 (that is [?] viable, [?]
the car)
