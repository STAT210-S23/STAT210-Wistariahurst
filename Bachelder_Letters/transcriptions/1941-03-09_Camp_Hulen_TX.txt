THE 211TH CA [AA] REGIMENTAL EXCHANGE

March 9, 1941

Dear Mother;

This is just a short letter to let you
mow I am out of the hospital and feeling fine. I was
let out on Friday. Due to my high temperature I felt
rather weak at first but I took it easy for a day or
two.

I am still working at the Canteen, doing a
bit here and there. I don't really believe I will be
here much longer. Soon there will be a shift in the
personnel and I am sure I will be put back in the battery.
I don't care very much where I am as I don't think it
makes very much difference. It might be an opportune
time to go back to the battery as it is quite consistently
rumored that our battery will go El Paso for a few
weeks of intensive drill. That is quite a long way off
and is supposed to be quite a place. It is very much out
in the desert and on the Mexican border. However all that
is speculation and I won't know anything until we actually
are on the way.

Time is flying around here. Tomorrow I will
have been in the Army five months and nearly half my time.
I am sure that the second half will go even faster than
the first.

This after-noon I plan to go horseback riding
again. It is a beautiful day with the sun shining and
and moderate breeze. It would be quite warm if it wasn't
for the breeze, but as it is, it is very nice. Its a
perfect day for sailing. Unfortunately I don't know anybody
who has a boat although there are a few little cat boats
on the bay.

I received the package with the socks and
food. Thanks a lot. Will you please keep your eye open for
some socks the same or of similar type. I use up a lot
of socks. The laundry is hard and the shoes are rough inside.

Lots of love to all.
