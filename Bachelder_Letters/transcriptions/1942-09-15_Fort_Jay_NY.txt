Monday

Dear Mother;

Julia suddenly reminded me that I have
again been remise in writing. I thought that I
had written quite often. Time seems to fly around
here.

Last week-end, Labor day, I went out to
the boat. I presume it will be the last time. The
weather was beatiful but there was a definte chill in
the air in the evening. I wenn in swimming several
times and I guess will call it a day for the summer.

Early and I are running into difficulty as far
as finding an apartment goes. You see the owners want
a lease and we can't sign a lease. Then when they find
out we are in the Army they won't sign a lease anyway
as we can't be sued or made to pay. So as yet we haven't
had very good luck. However we are still thinking about
it and possibly something will turn up.

I have about decided not to go to law school.
I find that the cost is a bit more than I can afford
because I find myself badly in need of clothes. There
also many other factors which I mentioned before. If
things change or something else happens I can start in
in February just as well.

Julia told me about lover. What is he now, a
toothless wonder? I hope you take good care of him and
give him my love. Incidentally keep some for yourself.

Work is going along as usual, the weather is
more conducive to work although I must say I am not
looking forward to snow in the city. Well I guess that
is about all. I'll write again soon and perhaps be
more newsy.

Lots of love,
F
