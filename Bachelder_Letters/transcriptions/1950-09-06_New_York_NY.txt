Wednesday afternoon
Dearest Moms:
I phoned you last evening around 7:30 but no answer.
I just wanted to tell you that I got the jobi I was all excited. Now that I
have gotten over it a bit, am writing instead.
I had another conference yesterday afternoon with Mre Brown and he said he would
, like me to work for him, so I said I would like to, toos I only hope I like it,
but from all reports it is about one of the best jobs in the place. And, hold
your hat = he offered me $5 a week more than I asked for{ Figure that one out!
I will be getting $7033 I never dreamed I could get another job at that figure,
anywhere = and especially here. Well, it all sounds too good to be truee Time
will tell.
I had & very busy day here at the office yesterday - so busy I didn't know what
to do next, let alone have time to think about being sleepy. Have been very
sleepy this afternoon, tho, the work having gotten caught up and therefore more
time to think about ite However, I was in bed last night at 10:35 and went
right to sleep and slept like a log through until 8 this morning. But what a
time with that old alarm clocki Can't imagine what happened to it to make it
gain 1 hour and 40 minutes during the nighte I hope the GE place on Walnut
Street can fix ite But maybe not, as it is pretty old. Father bought it, I
remember, so it must be 18-20 years olde If we need a new one, I will buy ite
You get it and I will pay for it, because they are nice things to have.
This weekend I am going either out to Fred's or out to the Thorne’s in Oyster
Bay - don't know which yet - for part of the weekend, at least. Haven't heard
anything more about who from Winchester is coming down to meet the girls. I
don't believe I will attempt it, especially in view of my new job, which I will
start right in on next Mondaye Mre Baldwin has been very nice the last two days.
Would really like to stay here, but if I can't have the best, will take the next
best, and I may like it even better.
He has gone home and it is just 6 so I am now goings too = early for me, but I
could stay doing work here ad infinitum] Tomorrow night I em going to stop off
at Franklin Simon's (they are opened Thursday nites) and get my much needed hair
cute
What & beautiful 2 days we have had. Too bad it wasn't like this over the weekend.
Guess that's all for this timee Had a wonderful weekend, dear. Take care and
write to mee
All love,
