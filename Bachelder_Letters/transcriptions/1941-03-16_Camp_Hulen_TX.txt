Dear Mother;

Things are about the same as usual around here.
Nothing much of import has happened since my last letter.
Friday we had a very super special inspection. The inspector
was some big-wig from Washington. It is believed that
if the inspection went well we would soon be moving out
of here. With polished brass, pressed pants, shined shoed
and clean linen we stood at attention. From what I hear,
things were in good order and according to rumor we should
know soon what our fate will be.

Yesterday there was a meeting of the regiment.
Colonel Hall gave a short speech on our progress according
to the training schedule. He seemed well pleased and talked
as though he thought we would soon move. Six months of
our year is now up and we are starting on a second and
more intensive period of training. I think this is my last
day at the Exchange........ Time has just passed. The
Exchange Officer just came in and told me I was definitely
out. Tomorrow I get up at 5;30 AM and become a regular
soldier for the first time. I don't think I will be sorry.
I am sort of tired of being a business man when all around
me there is the military. As yet I don't know how well
I will be received in the battery as they rather frown on
men who have been on special duty. Soon I will have a
talk with my battery commander and see what's what.

This is a good time to go back to the battery as
a new training schedule starts in effect and also tommorrow
the draftees become a a regular part of the battery. I
will have some company at being green.

I will stop now as I have a few things to
do so I will be ready to go to work. If you receive a
box within the next few weeks don't worry. Will you please
keep ail my pictures together, also please hold the
belt.

Lots of love,
F
