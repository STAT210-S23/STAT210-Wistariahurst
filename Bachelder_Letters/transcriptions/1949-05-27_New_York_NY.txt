Dear Mother;

I hope this letter reaches you tomorrow,
I heard from Uncle Jack and he is still down in Florida, although
he is about ready to start North and has given me the name of a boat
yard where he will stop for a few days.

Tomorrow, Peggy and I are going to Washington to
visit the Randalls. She is a friend of Peg's who we know. He is in the
Marines but is now in Wasington. It will be the first time away from
Susan and I hope and think things will go all right. As you must know,
Julia is going to take care of her. It will give them a good chance
to get to know each other and at the same time will give us both a little
change. We'll be back Monday. Then I am going to leave on a fast business
trip out west to Dayton Ohio and Chicago.

Thanks for Susan's birthday present. We will put it
in the bank. She received quite a few dresses and now has enough for the
summer. Mrs. G gave her a birthday party in Northport. Mainly for the Mothers
of course with several friends of Peggy's and thier off spring.

Hope you are well and looking forward to your vacation
in Canada.

Love,
Fred
