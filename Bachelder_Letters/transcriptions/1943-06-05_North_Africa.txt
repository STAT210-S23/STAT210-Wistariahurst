Dear Mother -
This is just a hurried note to
say I arrived in North Africa o.k
and well and happy. Our trip was
boring, and negatively uneventful.
I believe I am going to get a good
job and am very relieved so far
with the set up. This letter is
only an arrival note and I hope
well [?] you soon.
Love to all, don't worry
Fred
