| Monday Evening 9/18/50
Dearest Moms:
Really, I haven't forgotten you. You will just have
this time, but if.you knew what a week it ee sock aeaee me
why I just simply didn't get around to writing. I will tell you about
it breifly only, as so mech has happened; will fill you in on all the
details when I see-.you. '
To go baek - a week from this immediate past weekend, I washed and
marketed in the morning and made the girls beds and just barely made "
s 4 PM train to Fred's. I spent the night, but it was good this time
as Peg hit on the idea of my sleeping in the day bed in their room and
she siept in the living room as she has to get up so early with the
babies. I heard them some, of course, wut was able to doze until
later in the: morning and it was much better. We went to bed early
Saturday night after a nice supper. Sunday was a cloudy day and rained
some. We just sat around. Skip came over. He had just that week
gotten back from 2 months in Montana and it was his first visit there.
He had dinner with use. Then Cap and Bobby drove over for a visit and
I drove back to Brooklyn with them and took the subway from there. It
was nice to see him again. Maybe you will be seeing him and Fred, or
maybe they were up last- week,as I haven't talked with Fred recently’.
Last week would have been a hard week just with the new job. I am
going to like it very much but this is the busiest season and I never
now what I'm doing, I have so much work to do and it is all so new
and unfamiliar it takes me mich longer than it would if I knew more |
about it. I go in at 9 and stay til 63 30. Every Gebte there is very
nice and I feel it will work out all right, but it is quite a strain -
doing new work with a bunch of new people and I have been dead every
night. Then, on top of that, what & time we had here all last week.
Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Mauldin, Mrs. Quimby & Anne all drove down Monday =
fn two cars as Anne's went with her to Europe. Aunt Bess and I got
supper for them all here. Anne stayed up at the Fields and Mrs.
Quimby here, with the other 2 at the Holley Hotel. It was exciting
just anticipating the girls' getting back and, in addition, we knew
Monday night that°they were in an awful hurricane at sea, so neither
Mrs. Q nor I got to sleep very soon and we rocked all night.
Tuesday morning =- everyone for breakfast. Then calling up the French
Line all day to find out what time they docked - first 8 AM, then 1 PM,
they finally docked at 5:30. I left work at 6 and took a cab up to the
pier. People were just coming off the boat, by ones & twos. Of
course I didn't really know whether I'd missed them or not, but I didn't
think I had so I stood around from 6 til 7:30 when I saw Hat and her
mother coming. (Mrs. M& Mrg.Q. were the only ones who got passes to
meet them in Customs). We sat around and waigted til 8:15 when lirs.
Murray appeared. Helen was still waiting for luggages to come out of
the hold. She had been saddled with extra parcels from Shelagh's
mother for a sister in this country. so we left her there. Aunt Bess
had stayed here and gotten dinner ready for us all. Helen took a cab
down all by herself and dian't get here until 9:45. Was she ever
tired! Of course, we all were by that time, too. Hat looked simply
terrible, skinny as a rail. she got a bug in #ngland and Helen said
rat @idn't eat a thing for 2 weeks! She looked it. Helen lost weight,
too; also Mary lost as mach aS Hat did.Haven't seen her yet; missed her
ra

at the boat. Of course, Tuesday,Wed & Thursday nights, with the mothers
still here, we never got to bed - would get talking about the trip, Ae,
Then, on top of it all, Anne was taken sick on Tuesday, in bed all day,
had a miscarriage tuesday night, was taken to the hospital at midnight.
Much todo about whether or not she could sail thursday. ‘The car had to
go anyway, for Mark, so Mrs. M & Helen had to put that abozrd on Wednes-
day; make special-arrangements for Anne if she could go,ete. She finalz
did go, right from the hospital to the boat in an ambulance thursday
noon. HKisky business all around, we thought, but hope she gets along al
right. Guess she had done too much to get ready to go. We ate all our
suppers here as everyone was too tired to go out. Mrs. Murray was exhaus
ted. Aunt Bess did-all the cooking and marketing. Mrs. Murray,4unt
tess & Mrs. & all left for home early Friday morning, Mrs. Murray
driving her car. that night we 3 were alone for the first time = ate ot
as it seemed easier, but it was 8:30 when we got back, exhausted. Had
to do some washing and get to bed early, so no chance to write then.
__—s saturday stayed in bed til 10:15. Got going slowly, marketed, Helen & I
went uptown very briefly; I had to buy-a new -girdle so I could wash ———
the only one I owneé which was- filthy. shen I took a 4 4M train to |
uyster Bay to visit the Thornes. Had a nice time; spent the night.
Sunday was a simply gorgeous day. We were all out, doors all day. Edna
& I did school work out in the sun in the morning; we had dinner out-
doors, took naps on the grass in the sun, took a walk. I got lots of
nice red color on my fac, which looks fine today. 1 got home shortly
after 9 last night - got to the office at 9 today, home at 6:45, and
here I am. .
So - am I forgiven, dear, please? Last week was just one of those full
of hectic days we all run into once in a while. We are back to normal
now, going to bed early for a change.
i got a nice letter from Arthur congratulating me on my new job. It was
nice of him to write. 1 was so surprised. Wiil show it to you.
ie “~~ *
it also got an invitation to wedding & reception of Philip Gridley. I ae
will plan to come home next for that weekend, as it is only 2 weeks off. Ny
Needless to say, £ am not going to send a present, so please put my ae
card in with yours & 1811 give you something towards G6 | tS
there are lats of @etails on all the above, and my job, I will tell you a
about. Got nice presents from Europe, etc. Dut Helen says it is time Ss
to go to bed. She gets us in early as she has to get up so early. 4 \Y
miss not being with Mr. Baldwin: but I have met his assistant and don t G
think I like him, so maybe it's just as well. a
Hope to hear from you again soon, dear, 1 won't let so long a time x
elapse again very soon before my next letter. ‘ RY
