Camp Robinson, Arkansas

Dear Everybody:

I am very much afraid that too much time has passed since that super
cocktail fiesta and that I am very remiss in saying thank you. It is not
however because I didn't appreciate the swell send off. Tonight there are
sheets of rain beating down on the roof of our shack and the very memory of
the good-will and good cheer at that gathering gives me a nice warm feeling -
a bit thirsty too! I may be a little partial it was the best damn farewell
party of them all and I certainly appreciate all the work that went into
arranging it. So from the botton of my heart I say thank you all a million.

While in training in Washington I saw Betty Reeve who seems to be enjoying
her work. Every time we met we discussed in pleasurable detail the party.
I looked in the gym one day and had a laugh watching her struggle with a
group of about two hundred with the various paces of square dancing. Good help
the wounded vets when those gals get them on the dance floor in those muscular
numbers.

I'm down here for a spell getting my final training before being shipped.
The work is very interesting and life in the Army has its advantages as well â€”
such as cigarettes, good food, etc. The only think I can't get used to is
being saluted by the poor GIs who on this post are required to show this
courtesy to the Red Cross. At the end of the first day my arm was stiff.
In Washington the only salute I got was from a group of Chinese soldiers
who quite understandably couldn't tell what the hell I was.

Well, cherrio folks. As soon as I get a permanent address I'll send it
to Mae Gardes and I'll hope to hear from some of you once in a while. In
the meantime thanks a lot for everything and luck to you all.

Yours,
