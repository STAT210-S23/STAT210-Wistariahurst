AMERICAN RED CROSS
Sunday

Dear Mother;

Received your letter yesterday and ,
thanks. It seems like a very quick service
compared with the weeks formerly needed.

As yet I have nothine to report. You
must understand that the delay means nothing but
just is evidence that the Army medical takes its
jolly time. However I myself am in no rush, having
no place to go in particular anywya. Each day or so
I have a test made on me and tomorrow I am going to
have my teath tended to. I also have had a cheek up
on my sinus although that is not what I am in here
for. I suppose  I will be out in another week or so.
But anyway the thing is net serious and I might as
well be here as China.

Today I slept all day. Yesterday I spent
reading a book, and taking a shower. Nothing more,
but my demands are few and simple.

I hope you have an enjoyable time on your
vacations. Don't bother about me. I don't think I
will get any more time off as they don't give sick
leaves any more. It was found that te boys came
back fomr their leaves more tired and sick than
when they left. Such is life.

Enjoy yourself and lots of love,
Fred

PS. I would like the slippers. Nothing more,
