AMERICAN RED CROSS

15 August

Dear Mother;
I know you must be hapry and thankful that
the war i over. I have been fortunate and we have
much to be thankful for. It came as a surprise to
me as I had anticipated a long struggle. The news
came when I was here in the hospital and was celebrated
in a quiet menner with a minimum of excitement

The thing now is how soon I will get out of
the Army. I think I will be out of the hospital the
end of this week or the first part of next. I am
well rested and barring any unusual strain or
circumstance everything will be ok. I hope that
I can avoid gettimg an assignment now and if that is
true I showld be discharged. It is really too
early to tell but we can hope.

Last week-end in anticipation of V day I
went to New York. It made no difference that
I forgot that Julia would not be there. I would have
gone anyway as I didn't want to spend another V day
in bed. I spent the nights in her apartment and
During Saturday and Sunday I was xxxx with Pam.
I was hoping against hope that peace would be
ammounced but it was just not in the cards.
However I had a good time and was glad that I went.

I have been receiving your letters and it
seems that you have been having a good time. Now though
I guess it is all over. Just after your vacation
the gas rationing goes off. Toe bad, but then at least
you were able to go.

I received the packge with slippers ok and
thanx. Will write again soon as I know what will
happen to me 
Fred
