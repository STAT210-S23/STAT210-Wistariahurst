Thursday Morning

Dear Moms:

Just a quick few lines as Mr. B. will be in any minute.
Thanks for your letter saying you would just as soon have
Harriet with us for the weekend. She is a nice girl and
would love to come—it's a long weekend to spend in the city
alone in such nice weather, and I would love to have her, too.
However, she has to work Friday night, so won't come up with
me. She will come up on the 12:30 Saturday noon train, getting
in Holyoke at 4:15. She doesn't have to work Tuesday morning,
so will go back with me early that day. She is very worried
that you will go to extra work for her, so don't do anything
you wouldn't do if she weren't coming. She wanted to bring up
a cake, but that would be hard to carry, so I vetoed it. We
can get one at Howes. I'm sending you now 30 red points and
we'll both bring our books home, so if you market Friday and
need more, say I will pay them more red points on Saturday.
I can't send you a check, but we get paid today, so I will
bring plenty of money with me. Save the marketing until
Saturday, if you want to—perhaps ordering on Friday?

Don't know what we'll do with the baby——-bring him, perhaps!
(Not really, tho.) She fell out of the window Saturday to
the hard pavement below, but didn't get hurt!

It is warm again today—-guess we'll have a warm weekend, but
hope it won't be too hot.

Will take the 6:10 on Friday, dear, and see you the usual
time. If you'd rather have me take the bus home, don't come
to the station and I'll do it that way. So if I don't see
you there, I'll take the bus.

There is no news, and I'll see you tomorrow night, anyway, so
will say good—by for now.

All my love,
Susan
