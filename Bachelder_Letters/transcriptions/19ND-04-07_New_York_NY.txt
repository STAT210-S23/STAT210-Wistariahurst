April 7

Dear Mother;
I am looking forward to seeing you over the Easter holidays,
I hope the weather is nice and warm and not windy as it has been these
last few days. Our daffodils have come up already although the grass is
still pretty dark and dingy looking.

You have a big surprise in store for you when you see Susan.
She is a big girl now and quite different from when you last saw her. She
keeps us busy and worried but she is a wonderful little girl and gives us
a lot of laughs.

We can leave our plans somewhat open but I think it might be
nice for you to have Easter dinner out at our place. It is only an hour
out and you could come out after church and the Easter parade. I think we
will be alone and you could see the little one in the after-noon,

I had in mind that I migth drive you back. Do you have anybody
thet has a xx crib or some thing that Susan can sleep in? Don't set it
over but try to find out if we could borrow it. She has to be tied down ,
into most anything as she climbs all over the place, We have straps etc.
but a regular bed is too large.

Dave Schilling came to town last Friday and he sayed over
night at our house. We got a baby sitter and went to the Officers Club
at Mitchell Field for a while. Saturday night we had a Dartmouth dance
in the Garden City Hotel. It was for all of Long Isalnd. So you see
last week-end we were busy buy it was the first time in many months,
The old men is still in Florida and as yet I have heard of
mo plans for coming North,
Well I mast sign the mail now and run and catch my five-twenty
five train.

Love
Fred
