Monday Afternoon

Dear Mom:

Back safely after an easy and pleasant trip. We got into Springfield in
plenty of time to make the early, 6:35 train. Mary Holdsworth and Kay
Machmer and her sister all from Amherst were on the train. They hailed
me and we played bridge all the way down. The sister left at Hartford
and shortly after a young midshipman joined us as a fourth. It turned
out that he was from Amherst, too, but being quite a bit younger than
the other girls, they didn't know him. I reached home about 10:15.
There is no news at this early date, so guess I'll stick this in an
envelope just as is so you can know that I'm back in the old routine
safe and sound. Will be alone at the apartment this evening; plan to
do some washing.

Will write again soon. I so enjoyed being home and I've thought all day
about that wonderful meal we had yesterday. Hope you will enjoy it the
rest of the week.

OOOOdles of love,
Julia
