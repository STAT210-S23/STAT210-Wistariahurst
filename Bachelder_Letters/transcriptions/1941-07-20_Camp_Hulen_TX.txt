Dear Mother;

Here I am again writing to you from the
Canteen. Not that I have gone to work here again, but
just that I much rather write on a typewriter than
by long-hand. Fortunately I can use this machine
every now and then.

I received the package yesterday and
thanks a lot. The brownies are being enjoyed-by the
tent and I will wear the glasses from now on. They are
are much better than the ones I bought.

These days we are having a series of 'alerts'.
The other day we were awakened about twelve and took
a ride in the back until four. We were a bunch of tired
boys the next day. I am still working in the supply
room. The work is regular and although long its not
too hard and I can stay out of the hot sun. Its pretty
hot down here these days and I guess August will be
even hotter. However it rains now and then, and the
breezes usually blow so it isn't too bad. Last night
it rained in the tent and everything got wet. I didn't
even wake up. You really ought to see what I can
sleep through. With radios blaring, lights burning
and five people talking, I go to sleep.

The boys that went home on the first
group of furloughs have now come back and they
bring with them big talk of New England. As you
probably know, there is still nothing definite about
getting out. It sure is a big problem and the subject
is the favorite for conversation. I am fishing around
for the heck of it, nothing definite in mind but I
wish you would forward any mail I get as soon as possible.

Well I have to eat now, so I'll say
good-bye. Thank Julia for her overwhelming generosity
and give her my best wishes and luck in her new Job.
Love ,
