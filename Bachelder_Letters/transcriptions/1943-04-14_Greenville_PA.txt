Dear Mother -
Well here I am in another big army
camp - as confined as every and wandering
around trying to get settled. It somewhat
easier though being an officer as there are
more facilities available such as a truck,
some helper etc.
We arrived in NY.C. Sunday and I went to
bed early. Monday I spent buying a pair of
pants and went to a movie in the
after-noon. In the evening I took [?] am and
to dinner and we quiet about 1'o'clock.
Tuesday I packed [?] a late dinner
with Cap, called into Julia, and went to the
ferry which took me to the train. The
train ride was very uneventful. I went to
bed at 8:30 and slept, barring a few
sudden awakenings, until 7 o'clock when
I drove, worked, had breakfast, then [gifted?]
the porter 50 cents and left the train at

Greenville. When I woke up there was
[now?] on the ground and it was [until?]
moving. at Greenville there was a 
little more but it had stopped moving.
Greenville is about [9?] miles from the
camp. There was a truck there and
we drove to camp. Then came the [?]
routine of checking in. I was stabbed
with a [?] of [?], filled out
a lot of papers and was attached to
a [campary?]. (we [?] below).
The camp itself is very grim. It
is brand new, with a lot of wall
tar paper [?] and very muddy.
It reminds me of Camp Hulen. It is
located right in the [?] [?] far
from a highway and is [partly?] on a
rolling hilley [flat?]. It isn't flat like
Texas.
As yet we don't know [really?] what
is to become of [us]. When I [?] we
I mean the other fellows located
in the barracks. Some of them are the
boys I knew of aberdeen. Others are at
new offices from other [schools?].

It is too early to tell what a ways
we are here. I'll know more after
a few days.
We eat in a pretty good [?] and
I understand it is fairly cheap. You
know how we have to pay for our
food.
Right now I am [utility?] on my car in
a [?] room. Each room holds two
people. The other fellow [?] graduated
from another O.C.S and seems very nice.
He was [married?] on his leave and so far
has done nothing but write letters. You
can [?] [?] that I didn't get
married.
Will I [?] I have about told you the
whole stay. I'll [know] unite again
when there is more to tell.

My address is -
