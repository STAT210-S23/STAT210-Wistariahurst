# STAT210-Wistariahurst
Repository for materials curated by students in STAT210 (Mining the History of Holyoke) based on materials from the Wistariarhurst Museum and Archive

We are enormously appreciative of the support that the class received from Wistariahurst archivist and curator of collections Penni Martorell.
Penni has been Holyoke's City Historian since 2010.
