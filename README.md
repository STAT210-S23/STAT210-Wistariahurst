# STAT210-Wistariahurst
Repository for materials curated by students in STAT210 (Mining the History of Holyoke) based on materials from the Wistariarhurst Museum and Archive

We are enormously appreciative of the support that the class received from Wistariahurst archivist and curator of collections Penni Martorell.
Penni has been Holyoke's City Historian since 2010.

Professor Frank Couvares contributed his time to assist the class in better understanding the history of Holyoke.
We also want to thank Zoe Jacobs for her assistance with course planning and logistics.
Funding support for the course was provided by the Amherst College Provost's office in addition to support from the Feldman fund.
