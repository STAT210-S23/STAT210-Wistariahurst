To the staff of the Oracle

	How dare you people print this paper? How dare you, you sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen year olds?
	How dare you ask us to support the grape strike, when we your elders don’t even know what you are talking about. More than that we don’t want to know.
	How dare you, at your tender ages, print articles on the anatomy of the military personality, when we your elders want proudly to send you off to wars so that we can wear our gold stars and know we've done the right thing.
	And your disgusting individuality, your long hair, your casual dress, when we've spent our lives so that you can look better than the Jones boy or girl and could feel good about ourselves.
	In short, how dare you think, how dare you question so much? You frighten us. We were so happy watching TV, drinking our beer, making passes at our friends' spouses.
	Why must you confront us with your lousy love and concern? I am disgusted!

								– Mrs. Edward  Beattie

					Nixon Eats Grapes
		
	In 1968 the Defense Department bought $12 million in California grapes, 15 times as much as in 1965, before the strike began. The Johnson administration supposedly supported the grape strike. Nixon, on the other hand, eats grapes!
