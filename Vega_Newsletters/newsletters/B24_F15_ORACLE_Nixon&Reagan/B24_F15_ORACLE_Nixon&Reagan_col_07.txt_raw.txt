To the staff of the Oracle

How dare you people print this paper? How dare you, you six-
teen ,seventeen,and eighteen year olds?

How dare you ask us to supvort the grape strike, when we your
elders don*t even know what you are tal’cing about. more than that we
don’t want to know.

How dare you, at your tender ages, print articlés on the ana-
tomy of the military personality, when we your elders want proudly
to send you off to wars so that we can can wear our gold stars and
know we've done the right thing.

And your disgusting individuality,your long hair, your casual
dress, when we've spent our lives so that you can look better than the
Jones’boy or girl and could feel good about ourselves.

In short, how dare you think, how dare you question so much?

You frighten us. We were so happy watching TV, drinking our beer,
making passes at our friends spouses,

Why must Wonfront us with your lousy love and concern? I am
diszusted!

Nixon Hats Grapes

In 1968 the Defense Denartwent bought $12 million in California
grapes, 15 times as much as in 1965, before the strike began. The
Johnson administration supposedly supported the rrape strike. Nixon,
on the other hand, eats rrapes!

Richard iiartin is a cop. A younz one. He is 22 and has been on
the Ney York force for a year.

The job's dirty and repulsive. There is the 13-yearold kid who
hits his mother with a hatchet to get aoney for a fix. There is the
adult vegetable who forces heroine into his His system by jamming an
eyedropver into open cuts, There is the women who wants to sell her-
self to get shot money but finds most of her customers are frightened
away by the dope sores.
