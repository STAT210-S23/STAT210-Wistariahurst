	FROM THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT YOU VIETNAM:
		THE ANTI BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEM

	The Pentagon now has about 500 lobbyists in Congress working to get the ABM Bill passed. The Senate is now evenly divided in the debate. 
	The ORACLE has taken a stand against the proposed ABM System because:

		1. it will be obsolete before it is finished
		2. It will propagate the arms race
		3. made entirely to protect our missiles rather than our people
		4. cost will add immensely to our already high defense budget
		5. will be only a first strike defense and will be of no use against second and third strike

	American cities have burned for four successive years – not from foreign attack, but from internal despair. The President wants to spend at least six billion dollars for more useless military hardware, but hasn't found a deterrent against the Molotov cocktail.
	According to the independent daily Statesman of New Delhi, what an ABM system adds is merely a new dimension to the missile race, one that will upset the present precarious balance of nuclear terror, and thus direct the entire race to more horrifying goals.
	From Copenhagen's liberal POLITIKEN: Mr. Nixon's ABM announcement is a further blow to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty...One fails to see a new Nixon, only the old weak and insecure politician.
	According to Stockholm's EXPRESSEN: The U.S. plan arouses evil forebodings that the world political climate has deteriorated further. How can the Russians interpret this new step towards arms escalation except as a challenge which must be met?
	London's leftist intellectual weekly NEW STATESMAN observed that Nixon's primary political mission is to give military “hardware” as the bobby prize to Pentagon generals and war manufacturers now faced with a sense of real and spiritual loss in Vietnam.

	May is the time for restless energy to erupt. It is a time of revolution and we are dedicating it to the American Indian.

	We are not individuals. We can not afford to be individuals. People on top of society can afford that, but people on the bottom can't. I am inseparable from my brothers. What counts is the movement not me.
