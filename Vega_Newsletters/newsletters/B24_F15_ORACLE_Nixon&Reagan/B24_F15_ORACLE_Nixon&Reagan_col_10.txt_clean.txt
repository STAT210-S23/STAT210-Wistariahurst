	We as people are born with few natural instincts. Our whole life is based on what the institutions and our environment have taught us. The few that we are born with are self-preservation; the desire to know; and companionship. Some think that the feeling to get ahead, the acquisition of land, competitive spirit, and the striving for power are with you from birth, however, are actually the products of society with which a person is destined to be burdened; burdened in the sense that a man may have to die depending on on what his institutions and environment have loaded on to his mind. In our culture, we have formed a method of punishment for men which should be placed on society's institutions, for they are to blame of a person infringes upon another man’s rights, or has committed some other criminal act. Due to the fact that a person is taught what he knows and does, he is not responsible for his actions. We should not say “look what that man has done”, but rather, “look what we have done to that man”. Executing a man for society is as stupid as killing the child of an unwed mother.
	Another reason for the abolition of capital punishment is the recently discovered xyy chromosome which could be a biological cause for criminal behavior. Again, how can we blame a man for what is not his fault. The solution is not to kill these circumstantial victims but to control their environment, not tightly, but more or less watching them and helping them through times which may divert their attitudes to criminal actions.
	At times we could all feel hatred and anger which may exceed the boundaries of rationalization and completely take over our bodies and minds. At these times we are temporarily insane and have no control over our actions. Executing people for this is relative to murdering all the permanently insane who have little or no control over their actions.
	We can not free people who have done something wrong but rather reform these people. To do this we are going to have to radically change our prisons and houses of corrections so that the confined will become rational human beings.
