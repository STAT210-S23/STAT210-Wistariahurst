San Francisco Presidio: Part II

	On October 14, 27 prisoners staged a sit-in at the San Francisco Presidio protesting the killing of prisoner Richard Bunch, 19. “He was shot in the back while running from a guard on a suicidal impulse.” Bunch was quoted as saying to the guard, “What would you do if I ran?" The reply was ‘I would shoot you.* Bunch remarked, “OK, just aim at my head.” A shot was fired and Bunch lay dead. Witnesses confirmed that no warning shot was fired and no shout of “Halt” was made. 
	The 27 prisoners sat in a circle and made demands for better food, the disarmament of over-armed guards, and a full investigation into the death of Bunch. “It was beautiful,” a military photographer said. They sang “America the Beautiful,” and “Ye Shall Overcome.” They were then presented with mutiny charges. Three of the 27 have fled to Canada. The rest have received sentences ranging from 14 to 16 years of hard labor.
	The average age of these “mutineers” is 19 1/2, and most of these men are in the Presidio on simple AWOL charges.

					“CHE” GUEVARA

	On Monday, October 9, 1967, Ernesto “Che” Guevara was murdered. A bullet was shot straight into his heart. Che was the most wanted man of the CIA. He was Castro’s right hand man during the Cuban Revolution. When Castro was victorious, Che was given a post in the Castro Cabinet. In mid 1965, news of Che's whereabouts and activities ceased being published. Rumors started spreading. What happened to Che? Did Castro have him killed? Was he in Vietnam? Was he in South America trying to start a new revolution against the imperialist yankees? Then in 1967, his whereabouts were discovered, he was in Bolivia. He had visited north Vietnam in 1945 and had entered Bolivia under an alias. He was trying to start a revolution. His plans for a peasants’ revolution, however, failed, and he was captured by American trained Bolivian soldiers. In the little village of La Higuera, Che was held captive and murdered. Che died a martyred revolutionary hero. 

Che: “Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry, may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons.”
