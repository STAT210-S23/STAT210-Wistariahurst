I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Look~
ing Glass is dead, Tochulsote is dead. The old men are all
dead, It is the young men who say no and yes. He who led the
young men is dead. Is is cold and we have no blankets, The
little children are freezing to death. My people, some of
them, have run away to the hills and have no biankets, no
food. No one knows where they are-perhaps they are freezing
to death. I want to have time to look for my children and
see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them
amoung the dead. Hear me, my chiefs, I am tired. My heart
is sad and sick, From where the sun now stands I will fight
no more forever.

We laugh at the idea that blacks are taught to be subserviant - This
story told to some young blacks - Shows it to be true.
In the anciant times of Africa some young black children
vere teasing an older white man. As a result the blacks
would be punished by GOD for the rest of time and never
be forgiven.
we haven't gained the HILL - what we’ve gained is more restrictions.
You have long “dirty* hair - which means you have no morals
-establishment
