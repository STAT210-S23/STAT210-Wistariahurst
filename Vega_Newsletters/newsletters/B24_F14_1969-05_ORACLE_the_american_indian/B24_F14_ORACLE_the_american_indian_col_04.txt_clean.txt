YOUTH

FIRST we took over music
THEN we took over fashion
THEN we moved into politics
WE went into new hampshire and
	forced kennedy to be a candidate
WE went into wisconsin and forced
	johnston to retire
WE went to chicago and unveiled the
	democratic machine
WE opposed russia in
	czechoslovakia
WE greased the wheels of reform
	in france
WHO needs drugs ?
WEâ€™VE got a reality high 



OBLITERATION

Speak now for the hour is late
Dusk has fallen, wind has ceased
behold life, it is about to disintegrate...
all beings in a world of hate

implements of hate; nuclear warheads
helping man to destroy himself
and everything else along with him
and killing nothing less than
everything
this is how it will end.

- man ( a disease)


What we need is more law and order ?
