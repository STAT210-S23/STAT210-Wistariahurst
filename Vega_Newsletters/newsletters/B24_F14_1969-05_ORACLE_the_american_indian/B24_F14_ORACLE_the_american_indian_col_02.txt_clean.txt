I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is dead. Tochulsote is dead. The old men are all dead, It is the young men who say no and yes. He who led the young men is dead. It is cold and we have no blankets. The little children are freezing to death. My people, some of
them, have run away to the hills and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are – perhaps they are freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs, I am tired. My heart is sad and sick. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever.

We laugh at the idea that blacks are taught to be subservient – this story told to some young blacks – shows it to be true.
	In the ancient times of Africa some young black children were teasing an older white man. As 	a result the blacks would be punished by GOD for the rest of time and never be forgiven.

We haven't gained the HILL - what we’ve gained is more restrictions. You have long “dirty” hair - which means you have no morals
