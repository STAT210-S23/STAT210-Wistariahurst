Boys and Girls

How many times have your teachers referred to you and your fellow students as “boys and girls?" If you think about it, you can possibly recall hundreds of times when some teacher called you this and you can remember hundreds of other times when the administration told you that as young men and women you must accept the responsibilities of adults. For years you have been accepting these responsibilities and getting nowhere. The teachers just keep shrugging off more of their responsibilities on to you, the students, and allow you to suffer through your lives because of the lack of a good education.

You have been taking their shit and their responsibilities for too long. It is time to accept your own new responsibilities, the responsibilities for forming a new and better system of education in which no one will be discriminated against. Where you can wear your hair as long as you wish, where teachers and students shall respect each other and last. where you will be taught not only to remember certain people and places but to understand these people and ideas.

Not until a good system of education is established in which everyone will be taught to understand their fellow man will the hate that plagues our world today be overcome by love and understanding.

What our educational institutions are trying to do is make us exactly what they are, manipulated puppets eager to be controlled by an authoritarian power, The institution of higher learning has become a research lab for the mass execution of the people of other countries.

Black people wanted to be like white people. They went to school to get out of the ghetto, to make it in the white world. Now blacks are proud of themselves. They want to know their own heritage and culture. They want to be black. They don’t want to take away from the whites – they just want to bring their own community up with white community. That's what it’s all about.

There are 2200 Elk’s Club members in Holyoke. Of these, one Jew (by mistake) and no blacks are members. HOW COME?
