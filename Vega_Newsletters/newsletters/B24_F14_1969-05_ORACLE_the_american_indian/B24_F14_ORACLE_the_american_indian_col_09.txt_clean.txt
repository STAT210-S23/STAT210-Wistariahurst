“...it has been SDS which has called visible attention to the brutality of the local police, the obtuseness if not worse of university behavior to surrounding communities, the selfishness of university real estate operations, and the questionable character of some of the universities’ entanglements with the Pentagon projects. To say this is to: point out the considerable weaknesses of moderates and mild radicals.
	SDS has played the role of the farmer who clubbed his balky mule over the head with a two-by-four. When reproved by a humanitarian by-stander, he replies that the first necessity of the case was to get the animal’s attention. Although I care as little for the illegal occupation of buildings as I do for the clubbing of mules, I must also note the obvious: Both techniques do genuinely attract the attention of their targets-mules or university administrators. The likely beneficiaries of SDS action will be moderates and, if one is optimistic, the universities themselves."
