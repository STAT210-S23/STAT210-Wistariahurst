when the curfew was announced. Considering Country Joe's radical influence, I figured he could cause a confrontation very easily by. continuing to play. Therefore, I vas disappointed when at the end of “Fixin To Die” they quit.
	It wasn’t till later that I found out the reasons for their cooperativeness. It seems that when the group arrived in Boston, the Police Dept. immediately advised them to watch their step. Also, the followin day they were givin a benefit concert in New York to raise funds for
YIPPIE! non-leader Jerry Rubin whe was busted for grass.
	Despite the sound problems at the beginnin an the curtailment of time, the whole afternoon proved t be truly a Supershow. THE END.

	Up to 1868, nearly 400 treaties had been signed by the U.S. Government with various Indian groups, and scarcely one had remained unbroken. The Indians were promised new lands, then moved off them to some other place. They were shifted about again and again, as many as
five or six times. All of which led the Sioux chief Spotted Tail to ask wearily: "Why does not the Great White Father put his red children on wheels, so he can move them as he will?"

				WE WANT EQUAL TIME

	If the Administration will let the Marines have an assembly – let an assembly with a one-sided view on drugs be held – give out anti- Communist propaganda to be put up in every room – give out our names to the Armed Forces so that we will receive their propaganda – why not have members of the Black Movement, the National Mobilization Committee, YIPPIE!, Students for a Democratic Society, come and talk to us – if we are to be brainwashed from the Right- – let's play fair – let the Left in, too.
