“When as large a part of the population as the students become active and even violent it becomes necessary for checks to be imposed on their activities. Unfortunately, especially in California, these checks are often based on emotion. They only serve to further cast the government in an authoritarian light and to alienate the students. Although, there is no doubt that violence is wrong the government should not only be careful in how it attempt to handle the student problem but should recognize the cause of the unrest and seek to destroy it.”
