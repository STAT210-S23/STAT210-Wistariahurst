DID YOU EVER WONDER WHY TAKES ARE SO HIGH ?

Take a look at the federal budget. Of the $156 billion voted by Congress in 1968, 66% went to the military and to pay for wars past and present.

Only 15% to health, education and welfare.

Less than 2% to international relations, including peacekeeping and economic aid to developing nations.

The military has a big shopping list this year, too. And for years to come: more missiles, more bombers, more aircraft carriers. Even an anti-missile-missile which Sen. Church has called, “The most extravagant and expensive sieve ever constructed.”

WHAT FOR ?
The U.S and the U.S.S.R can already destroy each other – regardless of who strikes first.
… While American cities fester. While our children lack decent school. While we foul our air and pollute our water. While over 20 million Americans live below the poverty level.

IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE
One nuclear aircraft carrier costs as much as the entire Head Start program. The cost of a thin anti-missile system would pay for 2,500 new city schools.
WRITE TO YOUR CONGRESSMAN telling him to spend money on people instead of bombs.
