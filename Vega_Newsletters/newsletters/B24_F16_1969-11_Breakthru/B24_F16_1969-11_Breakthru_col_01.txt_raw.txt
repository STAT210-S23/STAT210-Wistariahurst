"The true rebel suffers the loneliness of integrity,
put experiences the exquisite joy of being his own
man whether 19 or 90. ...He finds his satisfacation
in his ability not to duplicate the life style of
others, regardless of age. He finds his modles in
history, in his imagination, but not in the loudness
of his peers.
«+.-There’is no one man who represents us-no hero
or great teacher who can tell us how to do it. It is
up to us to make our own decisions about our life,
our style, our contribution."
