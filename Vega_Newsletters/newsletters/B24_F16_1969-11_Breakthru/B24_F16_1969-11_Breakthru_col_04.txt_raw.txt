These photographs were taken a few works ago.
The "dump site" is located on Maple St. near South
St. It's next to the park where the new Senior
Citizen Home was just built. Ona clear day you can
see the Bellemy award High School from there.

We want to know why this is allowed to happen
to our land? Why have city officialg allowed this
to happen? The piles of garbage were dumped by city
trucks and in all probability the rest thrown by
citizens. Tires,cans etc. lay there and nothing has
been done to clear this up!

People must have noticed this disgraceful mess.
Then why haven't they brought it before the attention
of our municiple officers ? continued on page 2
