Once again, as always, that dig man
wno stalks the dances is doing his duty? to
the school. (By the way, what tsl'the school?"
Is it the students? It doesn't look that way.
Maybe it's the bricks and cement?) The dear
fellow is diligently checking out all the
Friendlys, Mac's, Mel's, Emily a ad Jenny's
etc. at lunch time, to See if he can catch
a student or two committing a vile deed such
as Ã©@ating at those places instead of at our
lovely cafeteria. We're sorry to hear that
he didn't catch anyone, but maybe on some
other rounds he'll do better. He's been
heard saying that he will continue his rounds
and even hit other places in the area. Maybe
if our Junior Detective can't catch anyone
committing such a heinous crime he'11 spread
his marvelous work to Chicopee, Springfield,
Westfield, - Who knows? - today the high
school, tomorrow the world for our own loved
Junior Detective.
Question: If he likes to get away from the
school, even for a short time, under the
guise of checking up on students ,- Why can't
we leave school at lunchtime? We could use
our lunchtime plus the time for homeroom as
a lunch hour. It would make for a much hap-
pier student body and would do little harm.
Answer: To any worries about the continued
operation of the cafeteria: There would still
remain enough students who would keep the
cafeteria going especially during the cold
weather. There are students who don't drive
or don't live close enough to home to leave
at lunchtime and stuients who'd prefer the
prices and convenience of the cafeteria.

Actually, the biggest problem might be
in keeping the teacher's dining room going.
