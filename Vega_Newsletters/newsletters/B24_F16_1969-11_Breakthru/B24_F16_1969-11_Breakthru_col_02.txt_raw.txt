What becomes of humanity, modesty, temperence,
gentleness, wisdom. piety; and what do I care about
them, while half a pound of lead, shot from six
hundred feet away, shatters my Body, and while I die
at the age of twenty in inexpressible torments in the
midst of five or six thousand dying men; while my
eyes, opening for the last time, see the town in
which I was born Sestroyed by iron and fire, and
while the last sounds in my ears are the cries of
women and children expiring under the ruins - all for
the alleged interest of a man whom we don't know?
-Voltaire app.1850
