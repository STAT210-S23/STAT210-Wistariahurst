With the current ban on the manufacture
and sale of cyclemates in effect, the nation
will be losing some billion dollar industries,
wut it's all for the good of the people.

Why then has the Gov't. not taken any
similiar action against another multi-billion
dollar industry,(of which the product is a more
definitely proven KILLER)- TOBACCO? I!
