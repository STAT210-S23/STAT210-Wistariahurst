or shut up. ,
We've been receiving complaints. People don't
like reading about Holyoke all the time. We also
sell in So Hadley, So. Deerfield, Chicopee, and
Springfield. All we can say is sorry. But how
can we write about 2 city or school we aren't
familiar with? So stop complaining to your
friends and write to us! Tell us what's onyour
minds. Drop us a note, tel 7 ing us whether you
dig us or not. Give us your suggestions on
improving. You are the paper and we can only
print what we think unless you send us your
thoughts.
