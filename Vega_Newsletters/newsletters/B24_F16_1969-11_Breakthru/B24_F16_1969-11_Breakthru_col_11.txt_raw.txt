The Feace Rally at H.H.S. on Oct. 15th was a ur
farce! As at every rally the band and the choir .
were immediately summoned for patriotic inspiration.)
the band played "The Age of Aquarius" and "Holyoke
High Fight Song." Aquarius was passable but when
the choir was instructed to sing SIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
the atmosphere of the suppossed "peace" rally be-
came unbearable! A wave of relief and hapry supri-
sed was noticable when the choir quickly substituted |
the word peace for the word ficht. ‘Two teachers zot —
up fron the history dept. and gave speeches about
the history of wars, which were irrelevent to the
topic of peace, and left none of our question an-
swered. Other people also save speeches but I'm
afraid they were censored for the mauled minds of
the students. It's too bad, they probably would
have been good speeches.

To add to the confusion, something was burning
in the building.

The question and answer period was indeed the
saddest part of the rally. It lasted a tremendous
seven minutes. The people were allowed to only ask
questions and not allowed to state their opinions.
These opinions were actually more important than
their questions. ach of the five people asking. -
questions were interrupted at least twice. when
time began to run out the chairman closed the rally
with these immortal words: " I think we've alivhad
enough f6od for thought ,now,I'm sure that all of you
are thinking about food for your physical needs."

At that moment, his ignorance made me so encry that _
my lest thought was food for my stomach. It's too
bad that the students themselves weren't allowed tc
Farticipate in the rally. If they had, the rally
would hav e possibly come off instead of becoming
another admistrative fiasco.

PEACE,
