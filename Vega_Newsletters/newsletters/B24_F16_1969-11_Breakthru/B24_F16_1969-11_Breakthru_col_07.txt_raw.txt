This area is also a playground of many children,
evident by the pictures. There is a park right next
to this garbage playground. If Holyoke is suppost to
have a great recreation area - Why do these children
prefer playing in filth ? Maybe the parks and play
areas the city builds are inadequate to grasp the
creative attention of our older children ? We think
that the city fathers should do some investagating
into the parks etc. we have and what Lind of play-
ground areas we do need !

Well are you going to sit back and do nothing ?
why not write to the Mayor, the head of the Sanata-
tion Department, the Recreation Department and the
Aldermen. It doesn't matter who is mayor or aldermen
or Department heads, this will continue unless we do â€™
something ! Demand an explaination! If we let this
zo by - the city might decide to dump the next load
of garbage on your steps. >
