	In dedicating an entire issue to Black Power, this paper is not advocating the supremacy of any one race, be it white, black, red, or yellow. We are exercising our policy of "telling it like it is."

	1. letting anyone rap on any subject
	2. bring before your eyes the injustice done to your fellow brothers and sisters...the Black 	man, the Indian or any minority.

	We believe that the difference in the pigmentation of the skin a person is born with should not make a difference in his pursuit of happiness, We are advocating "Black Power” in the name of Democracy, and can only hope that you keep in mind the last phrase of the Pledge of Allegiance: "with liberty and justice for all."
	Our goal is equality for all. According to Webster's Dictionary, equality is the “state of being equal, especially in political and social rights.'' How can we say we have given equal rights to the blacks? Have they not died for this, their, country? Haven't they contributed their culture to the great "melting pot" called the United States? How can we be so blind and malicious towards our brothers and sisters and still call ourselves just and lawful? Why are we condemning the Blacks?

Hope for 1969
	“The gift to see that all Republicans are not evil, that not all Democrats are evil, that not 	all Negroes are evil, that not all Whites are evil, that not all ANYTHING is evil. The 		ability to see the paradox in every person.”

			Ray Bradbury, Fantasy and fiction writer, 
			from Psychology TODAY, Jan., 1969
