OUTCRY
as much as 2 surprise as the
outburst at holyoke community
college might seem to be, the
ery for reforms has been a
long time coming. . :
the question has risen as to
whether or not the student
body has any rights in the
institution of new courses
and voice in decision
making ¢
they are paying yo be taught
something which will benefit
their lives. the need to know *
about subjects long omitted
from school bocks is revelent
to our generation, to seek and
change.
adults have rnttled our brains
with,the all to worn cut,
specches on responsibilties.
now the students want reason~
able resbonsibilties. they
will probably be turned down.
ADULTS make up your simple
mind.

——Harat
The Mexician farm hand in
California has asked all
Americans to stop buying
grapes from California,
They are on strike. They
are non-violent. They
are asking for better
conditions to work under
and a better wage scale,
We are asking you to support
their cause.
