To the staff of the ORACLE:
I was very impressed with the first issue of the"ORACLE."
You have produced a thoughful, probing, and this might
: surprise you 2 bit, mature publication. By t*mature" I
“mean you do not fall prey to the sometimes natural
tendency to attack and negate, but rather keep to the
positive expression of views
Also by restraining yourself from the sometimes delightful
game of playing personalities, you have made the “ORACLE*
good and instructive rending, Keep to ideas as much as
possible, and avoid as much as possible, (it's bound to
ereep in to some extent) niggling at individuals.
As a journalist, your goals as outlined in the editorial
rather turned me one You undoubtedly will tred on some
toes, and disturb some long established thinking, but this
4s your purpose and it should be the purpose of any of us
who wish to survive the 1970's.
Keep up the good work, and with all good wishes, I am
