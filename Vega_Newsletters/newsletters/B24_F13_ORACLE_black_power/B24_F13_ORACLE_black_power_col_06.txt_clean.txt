Letter to the Editor

What are we afraid of? Why won't we speak out against the policy makers of the school? All who are dissatisfied with the present policies of this school should be willing to do something to change them.

As an individual, you can do nothing. United we can accomplish substantial gains. Would you like to wear your hair long? Wear it. Why should boys have a limitation on the length of their hair when girls do not. Do you want to smoke cigarettes in school? Do it. Why should teachers have the privilege of a smoking room? Why should they have the right while students are
suspended?

These are just a few of the many things that can and must be changed. The only way to accomplish these changes is by a mass effort.If there were 10 to 16 hundred students who showed their dissatisfaction by walking out, the administration would have no alternative but to listen. If we can get ourselves together we will be able to choose the freedoms that we are supposed to have and shake off the rule of a dictator and his puppets.

THE best stimulus for running ahead is to have something we must run from.

"MORE" is as effective a revolutionary slogan as was ever invented by doctrinaires of discontent, The Americas, who cannot learn to want what he has, is a permanent revolutionary. He glories in change, has faith in that which he has not yet, and is ready to give his life for it.

A SOCIAL order is stable as long as it can give scope to talent and youth. Youth itself is a talent -- a perishable talent.
