To the staff of the ORACLE:

I was very impressed with the first issue of the "ORACLE." You have produced a thoughtful, probing, and this might surprise you a bit, mature publication. By “mature" I mean you do not fall prey to the sometimes natural tendency to attack and negate, but rather keep to the positive expression of view.

Also by restraining yourself from the sometimes delightful game of playing personalities, you have made the “ORACLE” good and instructive reading. Keep to ideas as much as possible, and avoid as much as possible, (it's bound to creep in to some extent) niggling at individuals.

As a journalist, your goals as outlined in the editorial rather turned me on. You undoubtedly will tread on some toes, and disturb some long established thinking, but this is your purpose and it should be the purpose of any of us who wish to survive the 1970's.

Keep up the good work, and with all good wishes. I am

									Sincerely,
									William Dwight, Jr.
