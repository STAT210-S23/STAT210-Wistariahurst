A Jong time has passed
Since it first tock root
upon this carth.
Constantly dying and re-
proudcing itself
in such great numbers that
the infinite supply of food
had dwindled to crumbs.
It steals from others what
it lacks and thrives on
jenlLousy and deceit.
When will this plague of
creatures brought forth to
. desecrate the earth and the
"s heavenly bodies round her;
When will they end?
My friend I feel the end is
near, for their God has told
them soe
They will scon be extint
like so many viruses before then.
You ask me the name of this
blight: the name of this
dreadful disease?
