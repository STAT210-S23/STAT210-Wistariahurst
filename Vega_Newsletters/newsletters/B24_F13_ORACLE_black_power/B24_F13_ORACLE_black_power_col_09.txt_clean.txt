THE DRAFT: PART II

	The Selective Service System discriminates against the Black man. The blame, however, springs from our American society.	
	Because the Selective Service System operates without records on race, it is believed that it operates without discrimination. Statistics, however, prove this false.
	Blacks constitute 14.5% of the Army in Vietnam and 22.4% of the fatalities. The Government contends that they are trying to reduce these figures to avoid criticism and to combat the notion that the disproportionate combat death rate is intentional.
	The reason often stated for the high number of Blacks on the battle lines is that, when Blacks enter the Service, they have a lower level of education and fewer industrial skills than a proportional number of Whites. This reflects the lower standard of education for Negroes. The fact that many Blacks enlist for better living standards is strong criticism against the American society. 
	Further, the Negro has a direct disadvantage in that, a proportionally fewer number of Blacks attend college or graduate school and are therefore ineligible for college deferments.
	A recent survey showed that 30.2% of eligible Blacks were drafted, while 18.8% of eligible Whites were drafted. In mid 1966, only 1.3% of members of Draft Boards were Black. The Negro constitutes 12% of our population. This is why many Blacks favor the Lottery system.
	Blacks oppose the Vietnam war because, as the New England Regional Meeting of Black College Students declared, “We believe that America is the Black man's battlefield."
	In Adam Clayton Powell's words, “Here lies a Black man killed fighting a colored man for the White man."
