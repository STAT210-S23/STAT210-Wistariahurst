; In dedicating an entire issue to Black Power, this
paper is not advocating the supremacy of any one race, be
r it white, bleck, red, or yellow, We are exercising our
policy of "telling it like it is."
1. letting anyone rap on any subject
2. bring before your eyes the injustice
done to your fellow brothers and sis-
ters...the Black man, the Indian or
any minority.

We believe that the difference in the pigmentation of
the skin a person is born with should not make a difference
in his pursuit of happiness, We are advocating "Black Power!
in the name of Democracy, and can oily hope that you keep
in mind the last phrase of the Pledge of Al}jigience: "with
liberty and justice for all,"

Our goal is egiality for all. According to Webster's
Dictionary, equality is the ‘state of being equal'especially
in political and social rights.'' How can we say we have
Given equal.rights to the blacks? Have they not died for
this, their, country? Haven't they contributed their culture
to the great "melting pot called the United States? How
can ew be so blind anc malicious towards our brothers and
sisters and still call ourself just and lawful? Why are
we condemning the Blacks?
