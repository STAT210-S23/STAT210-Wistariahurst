Letter to the Editor
What are we afraid of? Why wont we speak out against the
pohicy makers of the school? Ail who are dissatisfied with
the present policies of this school should be willing to
do something to change them.
As nm individual, you ean do nothing. United we can
accomplish substantial gains, Would you like to Wear
your hsir long? Wear it. Why should boys have a limit-
ation on the length of their hair when giris do not. Do
you want to smoke cignrrettes in school? Do it. Why
should texrchers have the privelege of a smoking room?
Why should they have the right while students are
suspended?
These re just 1 few of the miny things thnt cin and must
be changed. The only wiy tc accomplish these chrnges is
py a mass effort, If there were 10 to 16 hundred
students who showed their dissatisfaction by wnlking out,
the administration would hive no alternative but to listene
If we can get ourselves together we will be able to choose
the freedoms that we are suppose to have and shake off
the rule of a dictator and his puppets.

THS best stimulus for running ahcad is to have something
we must run frou.
"MORE" is as effective a revolutionary slogan as was ever
invented by doctrinaires of discoatcit, Tho Americas, who
cannot lcarn to vant what he has, is a permanent revolution-
ary. Ye glories in change, has faith in that which he has
not yet, and is ready to give his life for it.
A SCCIAL order is stable as long as it can give scope to
talent and youth. Youth itself is a talent -a vorishable
talent.
