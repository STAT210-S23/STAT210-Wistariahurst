	"No Vietnamese Ever Called Me A Nigger“ A David Weiss documentary that deals with the people that Black Panther Bobby Seale calls “the brother off the block.“ Black bystanders and three Vietnam veterans talk candidly and spontaneously about the war in Vietnam and life in black America. It is obvious that they have strong opinions about the war and their situation.
	"Listen," someone remarks, “I've been living in Harlem all my life, and all we've got there are rats, religion, and roaches.” Another person comments, “What the Hell is the government doing saying they're fighting for freedom over in Vietnam, when we ain’t got our freedom right here. It don’t make sense.”
	Two middle-aged women talk on a street corner: “That's what I'M saying,” one says. “The black soldier and the white soldier come back home and both of ‘em go ask about an apartment downtown. You know damn well the white man’s gonna get it and the black man isn’t, so what the hell is the black man fighting for?"
	The most powerful moments in the film are the lengthy monologues by three ex-Vietnam war veterans. Dalton James, he was turned off by the GI's total contempt for the Vietnamese. “They use to call them ‘slopes’ or ‘gooks’ just like they'd call us 'Nigger' back home.” Preston Lay, “When the shooting starts in our community, I wouldn’t be wearing any National Guard fatigue uniform. If they think we won't use what we’ve learned in the Military to defend ourselves, they're crazy,” from Achmen Lorence.
	"Do you really think they’re going to put some of that money they’ve been wasting in Vietnam into our communities when the war is over? Are you kidding? They'd rather spend it on sending a man to the moon."
