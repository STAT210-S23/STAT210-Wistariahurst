"No Vietnamese Ever Called Me A Niger“ A David Weiss

7 documentary that deals with the people that Black Panther
Bobby Seale calls “the brother off the block.“ Black by-
standers and three Viet-lNam veterns talk candidly and spon-
taneously about the war in Vietnam and life in black
America. It is obvious that they have strong opinions
about the war and their situation. .

"Listen," someone remarks, “I've been living in Harlem
all my life, and all we've got there are rats, religion,
and roaches.“ Another person comments, “what the Hell is
the government doing saying they're fighting for freedom
over in Vietnam, when we ain’t got got our freedom right
here, It don’t make sense,”

Two middle-age women talk on a street corner: “That's
what I'M saying,” one says. “The black soldier and the :
white soldier come back home and both of ‘em go ask about
an apartment downtown. You kmow damn well the white man’s
gonna get it and the black man isn’t, so what the hell
is the black aman fighting for?"

The most poerful moments in the film are the lengthy

monologues by three ex-Vietmin' war veterns, Dalton James,
he was turned off by the GI's total contempt for the Viet-
namese, “they use to o11]1 them ‘slopes* or ‘gooks’ just
like they'd call us 'Nigger' back home.* Preston Lay,

“When the shooting starts in our community, I wouldn’t be
wearing any National Guard fatigue uniform, If they think
we won't use what we’ve learned in the Military to defend
ourselves, they're crazy,* from Achmen Lorenee. -

“Do you really think they’re going to put some of that
money they*ve been wasting in Viet-Nam into our communities

. when the war is over? Are you kidding? They'd rather spend
it on sending a man to the moon."
