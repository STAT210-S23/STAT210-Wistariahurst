OUTCRY

as much as 2 surprise as the outburst at holyoke community college might seem to be, the
cry for reforms has been a long time coming. 

the question has risen as to whether or not the student body has any rights in the institution of new courses and voice in decision making.

they are paying to be taught something which will benefit their lives. the need to know about subjects long omitted from school books is relevant to our generation, to seek and change.

adults have rattled our brains with the all too worn out speeches on responsibilities. now the students want reasonable responsibilities. they will probably be turned down. ADULTS make up your simple mind.

The Mexican farm hand in California has asked all Americans to stop buying
grapes from California. They are on strike. They are non-violent. They are asking for better conditions to work under and a better wage scale. We are asking you to support their cause.
