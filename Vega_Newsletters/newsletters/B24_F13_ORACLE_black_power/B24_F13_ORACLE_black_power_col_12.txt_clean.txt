A long time has passed since it first took root upon this earth.
Constantly dying and reproducing itself in such great numbers that the infinite supply of food had dwindled to crumbs.

It steals from others what it lacks and thrives on jealousy and deceit.

When will this plague of creatures brought forth to desecrate the earth and the heavenly bodies round her; when will they end?

My friend I feel the end is near, for their God has told them so. They will soon be extinct like so many viruses before them. You ask me the name of this blight: the name of this dreadful disease?
