7 THE DRAFT:PART II

The Sejective Service System discriminates against
the Black man. The blame, however, springs from our Amer-
ican society.

Because the Selective Service System overates with-
out records on race, it is believed that it operates
without discriminotion. Statistics, however, prove this
faises

Blacks constitute 14.5% of the Army in Viet Nam and
22.4% of the fatalities. The Government contends that
they nre trying to reduce these figures to avoid criticism
and to combat the notion that the disproportionate combat
denth rate is intentional.

The reason often stated for the nigh number of Blacks
on the battle lines is that, when Blacks enter the Service,
they h-ve 2 lower level of educntion and fewer industrial
skills than 2 vroportional number of Whites, This reflects
the lower standard of education for Negroes. The fact that
many Blacks enlist for better living standards is strong
criticism against the American society.
ca Further, the Negro has a dire ct disadvantage in that,
a proportionally fewer number of Blacks .2ttend College or
Gradunte school and are therefore uneligible for college

defcrments.

A recent survey showed that 30.2% of eligible Blacks
were drafted, while 18,8% of eligable Whites were drafted.
In mid 1966, only 1.3% of members of Draft Boards were Black.
The Negro constitutes 12% of our population, This is why

many Blacks favor the Lottery system.
. Blacks oppose the Viet Nam wir becuuse, as the New
England Regional Meeting of Black College Students declared,
; “We believe that America is the Black man's battlefield."
In Adam Clayton Powell's words, “Here lies a Black man
killed fighting a colored man for the White man." :
