Update

Nueva Esperanza received word in December
that the Preliminary Application with the Mas-
sachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) on its
first project, 550 South Summer and 12 Hamilton
Streets, received Official Action Status. What
does this mean?

The process of applying for a construction
loan from MHFA has a number of steps to it.
The submission of a Preliminary Application is
the first. A successful review by the Collater-
al Securities Committee and the full MHFA Board
gives the application Official Action Status.
After another review a Loan Commitment is made.
The last step is called Final Closing.

The work of the applving agency, in this .

. case Nueva Esperanza, does not end with the

submission of the Preliminary Application. AT]
along the process, various types of documenta-
tion are required. To receive Official Action
Status, 33 different documents needed-to be pre-
pared. Before Final Closing another 38 pieces
of information will be submitted to MHFA. Ob-
taining some of these documents often involves
the provision of other information.

Samples of the reauired documents are
as follows:
