					       Update

	Nueva Esperanza received word in December that the Preliminary Application with the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) on its first project, 550 South Summer and 12 Hamilton Streets, received Official Action Status. What does this mean?
	The process of applying for a construction loan from MHFA has a number of steps to it. The submission of a Preliminary Application is the first. A successful review by the Collateral Securities Committee and the full MHFA Board gives the application Official Action Status. After another review a Loan Commitment is made. The last step is called Final Closing.
	The work of the applying agency, in this case Nueva Esperanza, does not end with the submission of the Preliminary Application. All along the process, various types of documentation are required. To receive Official Action Status, 33 different documents needed to be prepared. Before Final Closing another 38 pieces of information will be submitted to MHFA. Obtaining some of these documents often involves the provision of other information.

	Samples of the required documents are as follows:

	* a description of the property and evidence of ownership
	* a surveyor's certificate
	* building permits
	* a construction contract
	* a tenant selection plan
	* a building management plan
	* a statement of affirmative action.

	Nueva Esperanza has successfully completed the requirements for Official Action Status and expects Loan Commitment from MHFA in January. Final Closing on the loan will probably happen early in the spring.
