@We are happy to announce that the winning
suggestion in our logo contest was made
by Annette Foley. Her idea was the phoe-
nix and was designed by Donna DiCarlo.

@ According to legend the phoenix was a
fabulous gold and red bird that period-
ically died and was reborn. When it
reached the end of its life (500 years),
it burned itself on a pyre of flames
and from the ashes a new phoenix arose.

A sacred symbol in the Egyptian religion,
the bird represented the sun which dies
each night and rises again each morning.

@ Our contest winner was born and grew up
in South Holyoke and remains a resident
of the city along with her husband and
three children. Ms. Foley has worked for
the city of Holyoke for seven years, the
past three as a secretary in the Com-
munity Development "ffice.

@Her memories of Holyoke are vivid and
happy ones: school days at Precious
Blood Grammar and High Schools, big
bands, sports events and vaudeville at
the Valley Arena (near Hamilton Park),
dancing at Roseland, corner stores, ice
and vegetable pedlars, milk deliveries
on the back porches.

@It was Ms. Foley's memories that prompted
her to suggest the phoenix as a logo for
The Community Builder hecause it is her
hope that out of the deterioration and
destruction of the past few years that
the life and neighborliness of the area
will be revitalized.
