America
The so Called "Democratic System" can only
function by means of force. This fact has been
amply demonstrated 1n so many areas of late that |
it seemgridiculous to list them, Vietnam, and the
Democratic National Convention serve as the two
finest examples abroad and at home that one can
cite. The Vietnam story is so old that we need
not repeat? But the Chicago Convention is fresh 2
enough in the minds of Americans to work up @
little enthusias over, IT WAS A FRAUD, Old men
are creatures of habit, they are fit to lead
oven older men. The spirit that once emerged
under the name of DEMOCRACY no longer resides in “mw
that word, iti igho longer represented by that word;
that spirit is all the HATE and RESENTMENT thet
the word DEMOCRACY Kindles. The spirit that was
called DEVOCRACY is. going to destroy THIS"DENOcRACY® |
But it 1s going to take men to do it. Not OLD NEN,
not cautious men, not angry men, it is going to
take MEN OF CONVIGTION. Hed there been even one
of them at the convention the whole fiasco would
have turned inside cut, There has never been a
gathering of peopge seeking a real men, But
not one came. There were little attempts, but
Little attempts produce little results. The angry
nob outside hai no power, they would never have
vequired GUNS AND TANKS to make thenselves heard.
The angry mob ineide had no guts, things gust
didn't get bad enough, YOU JUST GaN'T EXPECT A
MEN TO RISK HIS ENTIRE CAREER JUST BECAUSE THINGS
AREN'T GOING HIS WAY. No, nothing has changed.
The old men still have the power, they still be-
lieve they're in the right, They will continue
6% maintain LaW'N'ORDER(WHAT ABOUT JUSTICE?) Even
if they have to wipe out half the worlds»population
to do it. BUT WHO CAN BLAME THEM? THAY BELIEVE
THEIR CAUSE Is RIGHT. DO YOU?
