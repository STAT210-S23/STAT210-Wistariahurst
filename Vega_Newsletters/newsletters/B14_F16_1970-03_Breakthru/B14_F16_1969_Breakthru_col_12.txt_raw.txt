‘me innocenes you lost as a child io
found in death

‘The imnecence of the world was lost ia
creation and will be regained in destruction

You had innocence, why dia you lose 1t?
You cen regain it by dying, why don't you
commit suicide?

The universe wes innocent befere the o
creation of this planet. Do you think that
we were created only to be destroyed?

You must die every day. That is the
omly way to maintain your imnocence, You
must be reborn every day, that 1s the only
way to justify your existence,

It is the questions that count; the liv-
ing, the uncertainty. The answer becomes the
next question.

Now is the question, and now is the
answer.
