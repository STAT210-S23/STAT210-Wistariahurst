IS THIS WHY AMERICANS ARE DYING IN VIETNAM?

“A group of South Vietnamese businessmen, visiting Tokyo to speed up their orders for consumer goods —
cars, TV sets, transistor radios, tope recorders, etc. — admitted to a PARADE reporter thet the ARVN (Army
of Republic of Vietnam) is pretty much 0 corrupt joke, that it will fold like an accordion once the Americans pull
out. Sen. John Stennis of Mississippi, head of the Senate ‘Armed Services Committee and one of Lyndon Johnson’s
original warhawks, is also honest and realistic enough to acknowledge the same truth. The South Vietnamese Army
simply lacks the will to fight, to kill other Vietnamese, prefers to let the Americans do the killing and the dying.””
~ Parade Magazine, June 29, 1969.
