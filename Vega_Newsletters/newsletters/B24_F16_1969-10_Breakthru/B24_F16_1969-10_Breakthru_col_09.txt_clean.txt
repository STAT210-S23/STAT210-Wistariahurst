We are told that things are not well in North Vietnam. That may be true, but they can hardly be going half as badly as here. North Vietnam has no stock and bond markets, to fall steadily even
as inflation grows. As this is written the financial pages speculate that the U.S. may have to pay the highest interest rates since the War of 1812 to refinance debt coming due next week. It is the most dangerous nonsense to think that we can go on wasting "even" $10 billion a year in
Vietnam while inflation eats away savings and racial urban problems eat away the very foundations of our society. The message we have to take to the country is that the war and the Pentagon have become the No.1 threat to American security, and that we must get out of Vietnam and Asia before those quicksands are our ruination.
