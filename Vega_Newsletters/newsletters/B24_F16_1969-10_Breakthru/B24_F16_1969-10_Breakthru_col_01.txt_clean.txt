"The feeling of social claustrophobia is tightened by a system of conscription which makes the campus a draft haven and distorts career choices in an effort to avoid service in a war nobody want to fight. The deep misgivings about the war, compounded by the immorality of using an inequitable draft to fight it, generates a bitter skepticism of the values which motivate all established authority."

"If nothing is taken at face value, distrust soon puts an end to dialog. Nothing is worth saying because nothing is believed. Nothing is worth arguing because argument is not dealt with on the merits."
					- Pres. Kingman Brewster Jr. of Yale
