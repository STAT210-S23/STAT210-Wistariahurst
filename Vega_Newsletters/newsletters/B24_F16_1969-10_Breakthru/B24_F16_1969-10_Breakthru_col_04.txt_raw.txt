1944 report on marihuana by the New York
Academy of Medicine:

1. Smoking marihuana does not lead directly
to mental or physical deterioration.

2. The habitual smoker knows when to stop,
as excessive doses reverses its usually
peessene effects,

Â« Marihuana does not lead to addiction (in
the medical sense), and while it is natur-
ally habit-forming (as anything is--ed.),
its withdrawal does nat lead to the horri-
ble withdrawal symptoms of the opiates,

4. No deaths have ever been recorded that
can be ascribed to marihuana.

5. Marihuana is not a direct causal factor
in sexual or criminal misconduct.

6. Juvenile deliquency is not caused by mar-
ihuana smoking, although they are sometimes
associated.

7. "The publicity concerning the catastro-
phic effects of marihuana smoking in New
York is unfounded." :

8. It is more of a nuisance than a menace.
