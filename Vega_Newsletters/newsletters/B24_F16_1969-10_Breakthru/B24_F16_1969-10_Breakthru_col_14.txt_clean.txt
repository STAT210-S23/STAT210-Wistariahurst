				Why WMAS-FM IS OFF The Air

	One day there was some fill-in time before the WMAS news so Rob put on the Wild Man Fischer album. He accidentally put on the wrong side and for about 15 seconds Wild Man's “obscenities” were broadcasted. The minute Rob discovered his mistake he took the record off–but it was too late.
	One listener let it be known that he was upset. He said that he was listening to it with his young daughter, had it tape recorded, and was gonna get in touch with the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and the FBI.
	Rob said that he was sorry and it was an accident but, sure enough, the next day an FBI agent was at WMAS. Consequently, Rob and Lord Jim lost their jobs and the underground music format of MAS is gone. Now they're playing "safe music" – Henry Mancini, Dean Martin, etc.
	So now there's no good local station for freaks to listen to. If you're pissed like I am, I guess the only thing to do is write to WMAS 101 West Street, West Springfield.
	Bitch at them, tell them how much you dug the underground MAS, and ask/tell them we want
our music back. Maybe, just maybe, something will happen.
