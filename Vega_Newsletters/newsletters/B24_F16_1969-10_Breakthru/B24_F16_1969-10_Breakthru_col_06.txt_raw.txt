Evil hosts our countries
wa'tls enclose the weary
names of all those who
died in battles where the
only victor was
pain, they hide the flaming
faces
of the youth they
have to beat; i wonder
if this place will not
ignite
from all the
heate
the minister of this and
that ponders on who shall
die while presidents and
cabinets turn documents to
lies, they leave just nothing
for the poor mistreated
of the land, you know i
kmow that they will die *
but i don't know at
whose hand

ULTIMATELY YOU CAN LISTEN TO ONLY ONE THING,
NOT YOUR PRESIDENT,
NOT YOUR MISGUIDED LEADERS, SAVE A FEW,
NOT THE COMMUNISTS OR THE SOCIALISTS
OR THE REPUBLICANS OR THE DEMOCRATS,
BUT YOU MUST LISTEN TO YOUR OWN HEART,
AND DO WHAT IT DICTATES.
BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS THE ONLY THING
WHICH CAN TELL YOU WHAT IS RIGHT
AND WHAT IS WRONG.
AND AFTER YOU HAVE FOUND OUT
WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG,
THEN YOU MUST KNOW THAT YOU CAN SAY YES
TO WHAT IS RIGHT AND NO TO WHAT IS WRONG.
AND YOU YOUNG MEN, FOR INSTANCE,
IF YOU FEEL THAT TO KILL IS WRONG
AND TO GO TO WAR IS WRONG,
YOU HAVE TO SAY NO TO THE DRAFT.
AND IF YOU YOUNG LADIES THINK
IT IS WRONG TO KILL, AND WAR IS WRONG,
YOU CAN SAY YES TO THE YOUNG MEN
WHO SAY NO TO THE DRAFT.
BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE LEADERS AND THE
DICTATORS, IT IS NOT GOD
WHO IS GOING TO GET US OUT OF THE
BLOODY MESS WE ARE IN.
IT IS ONLY YOU AND ONLY ME.
