"The feeling of social claustrophobia is tightened
by a system of conscription which makes the campus
a draft haven and distorts career choises in an
effort to avoid service in a war nobody want to
fight. The deep misgivings about the war, compound-
ed by the immorality of using an inequitable draft
to fight it, generates a bitter skepticism of the
values which motimate all established authority."
