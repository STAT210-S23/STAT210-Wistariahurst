TANGLEWOOD (continued)

	Following B.B, King was one of the most spectacular shows ever given by a band with the “Who" doing their entire rock opera of “Tommy" plus two other Songs at the end. The acrobatics of the singer spinning his microphone and the guitarists jumping were only lead-ins to the last
number in which lead player, Peter Townshend threw his instrument high in the air, then caught
it and continued to play it accurately. Noticeably tired, the "Who" begged off pleas for an encore and left with a grateful “thank you",
	Next, "Jefferson Airplane" gave a mediocre if not bad showing, with all of their songs being totally different and of lower quality than they were originally recorded. (It was such that many were leaving early.)
	Throughout the entire evening, providing comic relief in the breaks, a segment of the famous movie "King Kong", and a freaky display of lighting combinations, the "Joshua Light Show" lived up to its world wide reputation of being the best in its field.
