YOUR EDUCATION

There is a world of difference between the modern home environment of the integrated electric information and the classroom. Today's television child is attuned to up-to-the-minute "adult" news — inflation, rioting, war, taxes, crime, bathing beauties – and is bewildered when he enters the nineteenth-century environment that still characterizes the educational establishment where information is scarce but ordered and structured by fragmented, classified patterns, subjects and schedules. It is naturally an environment much like any factory set-up with its inventories and assembly lines. 

The "child" was an invention of the seventeenth century; he did not exist in say Shakespeare's day. He had, up until that time, been merged in the adult world and there was nothing that could be called a childhood in our sense.

Today's child is growing up absurd, because he lives in two worlds, and neither of them inclines him to grow up. Growing up – that is our new work, and it is total. Mere instruction will not suffice.
