1944 report on marijuana by the New York Academy of Medicine:

1. Smoking marijuana does not lead directly to mental or physical deterioration.

2. The habitual smoker knows when to stop, as excessive doses reverses its usually pleasant effects.

3. Marijuana does not lead to addiction (in the medical sense), and while it is naturally habit forming (as anything is--ed.), its withdrawal does not lead to the horrible withdrawal symptoms of the opiates.

4. No deaths have ever been recorded that can be ascribed to marijuana.

5. Marijuana is not a direct causal factor in sexual or criminal misconduct.

6. Juvenile delinquency is not caused by marijuana smoking, although they are sometimes associated.

7. "The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marijuana smoking in New York is unfounded."

8. It is more of a nuisance than a menace.
