We are told that things are not well in North
Vietnam. That may be true, but they can hardly be
going half as badly as here. North Vietnem has Â©
no stcck and bond markets, to fall steadily even
as inflation grows. As this is written the finan-
cial pages speculate that the U.S. may have to
pay the highest interest rates since the war of
1812 to refinance debt coming due next week. It
is the most dangerous nonsense to think that we
can go on wasting "even" $10 billion a year in
Vietnam while inflation eats away savings and
racialurban problems eat away the very foundations
of our society. The message we have to take to
the country is that the war and the Pentagon
have become the No.1 threat to American secur-
ity, and that we must get out of Vietnam and
Asia before those quicksands are our ruination.
