YOUR EDUCATION
There is a world of difference between the modern
home enviroment of the integrated electric infor-
mation and the classroom. Today's television child
is attuned to up-to-the-minute "adult" news —in-
flation, rioting, war, taxes, crime, bathing
beauties-and is bewildered when he enters the nine-
teenth-century enviroment that still characterizes
the educational establishment where information is
scarce but ordered and structured by fragmented,
classified patterns, subjects and schedules. It is
naturally an enviroment much like any factory set-
up with its inventories end assembly lines.
The "child" was an invention of the seventeenth
century; he did not exist in say Shakespere'’s day.
He had, up until that time, been merged in the
adult workd and there was nothing that could be
called a childhood in our sense.
Today's child is growing up absurd,because he lives
in two worlds, and neither of them inclines him to
grow up. Growing up-that is our new work, and it is
total. Mere instruction will not suffice.
-Marshall McLuhan
