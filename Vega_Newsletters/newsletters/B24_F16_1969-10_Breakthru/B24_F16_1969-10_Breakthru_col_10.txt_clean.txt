IS THIS WHY AMERICANS ARE DYING IN VIETNAM?

“A group of South Vietnamese businessmen, visiting Tokyo to speed up their orders for consumer goods – cars, TV sets, transistor radios, tope recorders, etc. – admitted to a PARADE reporter that the ARVN (Army of Republic of Vietnam) is pretty much a corrupt joke, that it will fold like an accordion once the Americans pull out. Sen. John Stennis of Mississippi, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of Lyndon Johnson’s original warhawks, is also honest and realistic enough to acknowledge the same truth. The South Vietnamese Army simply lacks the will to fight, to kill other Vietnamese, and prefers to let the Americans do the killing and the dying.”

SAIGON, July 1 – "About 11,000 South Vietnamese soldiers desert their units every month, latest statistics show. This is an increase of about 25 percent over last year’s figures."

					– Robert G. Kaiser, The Washington Post, July 2, 1969.


“We cannot fool the American people into something which isn’t true. It’s perfectly obvious that President Thieu wants to maintain the fighting as long as possible, wants to maintain our troops there, in order to maintain his position.”

					– The Honorable Averell W. Harriman, formal chief negotiator of the Paris talks, June 10, 1969.
