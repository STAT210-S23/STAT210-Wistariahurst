	Operation Intercept has ended – Operation Cooperation has begun.
	Operation Intercept's purpose, to coerce the Mexican government into helping the U.S.
offensive against the influx of grass, has apparently been accomplished. The massive car searches at the U.S.-Mex. border caused fantastic traffic delays. Mexico's tourist economy was hurt because no one wanted to face the hours of waiting at the border. This is what the U.S. wanted because Mexico doesn't really care about the "drug problem.”
	But now, faced with economic problems caused by Operation Intercept, the Mexican government will help the U.S. – hence the new plan, Operation Cooperation.
	The whole idea of a war on grass, though, is pretty stupid to begin with. As everyone knows, grass is a harmless, pleasurable, hallucinogenic.
	If the governments cause a grass drought, they can cause more harm than they think they are trying to prevent. A lot of people who just smoke grass will not be able to get any. So they might do something they aren't ready for and get really messed up. For example, someone who is happy just smoking grass can't buy any because of a drought. But there's some acid around, so what the hell? So the kid isn't ready to trip and he bums out and gets his head really screwed up. All because the government wants to save us from the “killer weed".
