TANGLEWOOD (continued)

Following B.B, King was one of the most
spectacular shows ever riven by a band with the
“Who" doing their entire rock opera of “Yommy"
plus two other Songs at the end. The acrobatics
of the singer spinning his microphone and the
guitarists jumping were only lead-ins to the last
number in which lead player, Peter Townshend
threw his instrument high in the air; then caught
it and continued to play it accurately. Notice.
ably tired, the "Who" begged off pleas for an
encore and left with a grateful “thank you",

Next, "Jefferson Airplane" gave a mediocre
if not bad showing, with all of their songs
being totally different and of lower quality
than they were originally recorded. (It was
such that many were leaving early.)

Throughout the entire evening, providing
comic relief in the breaks, a segment of the
famous movie "King Kong", and a freaky display
of lighting combinations, the "Joshua Light
Show" lived up to its world wide reputation
of being the best in its field.
