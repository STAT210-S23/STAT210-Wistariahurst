Operation Intercept is ended--Operation Co-
operation has begun.

Operation Intercept's purpose, to coerce
the Mexican government into helping the U.S.
offensive against the influx of grass, has ap-
parently been accomplisned. The massive car
searches at the U.S.-Mex. border caused fantast-
ic traffic delays. Mexico's tourist economy was
hurt because no one wanted to face the hours of
waiting at the border. This is what the U.S.
wanted because Mexico doesn't really care about
the "drug problem".

But now, faced with economic problems caus-
ed by Operation Intercept, the Mexican govern-
ment will help the U.S.--hence the new plan,
Operation Cooperation.

The whole idea of a war on grass, though,
is pretty stupid to begin with. As everyone
knows, grass is a harmless, pleasurable, hallu-
cinogetic.

If the governments cause a grass draught,
they can cause more harm than they think they
are trying to prevent. A lot’ of people who just
smoke grass will not be able to get any. So they
might do something they aren't ready for and get
really messed up. For example, someone who is
happy just smoking grass can't buy any because
of a draught. But there's some acid around, so
what the hell? So the kid isn't ready to trip
and he bums out and gets his head really screw-
ed up. All because the government wants to save
us from the “killer weed".
