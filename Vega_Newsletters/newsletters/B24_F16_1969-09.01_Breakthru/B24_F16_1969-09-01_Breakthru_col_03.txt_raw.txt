A revamping of the Oracle has been in orders
Breakthru is the product of these renovations. Our
main policy is the same, to bring about construc-
tive change.. This paper belongs to no-one and owes
nothing to anybody. It is a paper from the people..
We want you to get involved, to be concerned about.
‘things happening for and against humanity, and
finally to act. To do this we must be together re-
membering that our purpose must be constructive
and fill a void rather create one. Act positively
if you disagree with the polices of a ruling body:
such as your city government and school administra-
tions.

( 0 show dissent in
yore Vietnam base (BASE IKE)

There were those on Fire

Base Ike prone to keeping their
heads down when the fighting began.

There were the Vietnam ve-

terans whose only concern was to get put alive
There were those who openly questioned wheather
all the fighting and dying was worth it.

There were those who tried
to escape the grim reality of Fire Base Ike with
drugs. Just that day two qpoktss were shiped to
the rear because their préfice might endanger the
others.

And the dissenters talked
every day about their doubts, thus threatening to
undermine the fighting spirit that Lindsey felt
he needed.

There were thosewho were
openly disobedient. A few days earlier 5 infantry
men temporarily refused to man an overnight obser-
vation post because of the danger.

Another soldier was sent
pack because he wouldn't fight.

Another shot himself in the

foot to get out.
