“Finally, Woodstock raises the questiom of
dames. Psychotropic: drugs are now as: much a
part of the youth subculture as alcohol is
part of the adult society. It 1s long past
time when our laws should reflect this resl-
ity. It is hypocrisy to jail youngsters for
five years for possession of marijuana while
permitting men to make fortunes selling can+
cer in a cigarette pack.”
