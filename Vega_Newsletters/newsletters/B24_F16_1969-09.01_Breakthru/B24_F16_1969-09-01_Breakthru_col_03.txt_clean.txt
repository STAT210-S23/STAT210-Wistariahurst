No More Vietnams

	A lesson has been learned by the majority of the U.S. Senate concerning Vietnam. The Senate approved a resolution (70-16) stating that a “national commitment" will result only from affirmative action from both legislative branches.
	This is a step in bringing the presidential powers, in the area of foreign policy, under control. Simply it is a warning to the Executive branch not to involve the U.S. in more Vietnams.
	Under the Constitution a system of checks and balances was set up to prevent any one branch
of the government from gaining more control than another. This system sets out to find a balance between tyranny and chaos. Post W.W.II years have seen the shift of foreign policy almost entirely to the president with Congress merely doling out money whenever and wherever the Executive wishes. The job of Congress was to do without questioning.
	No decision by the Supreme Court has judged the war we are now involved in as unconstitutional. Instead the people are showing it through widespread dissension. Riots on campus, marches on the Pentagon and the Capital, the dissolution of ROTC on many colleges have brought to Congress the dire situation. Approval of the resolution is the reaction of politicians who want no more international commitment decided on by one person or one branch of the government.

Of South Hadley High School,

	Education in S.H.H.S. is far from what it should be. Like other schools it trains the students for the business world instead of a social world and one's self-knowledge.
	Last Thursday I was dragged, by the ear, down to the office for looking out the window during my study period. When I got down to the office I was met by a member of the administration. I received 20 demerits and a lecture about how it was the first week and I was starting off on the
wrong foot and all that shit. But these were just the circumstances that started a discussion concerning education today. He said, "Education today is primarily to get kids ready for the business world", and he added, "making a good financial life.”
	Feeling the way I do that school should first teach a student responsibilities and how to sensitize with others, not to be trained how to be a good worker for Dow Chemical Corp., I felt sick.
