“Finally, Woodstock raises the question of drugs. Psychotropic drugs are now as much a part of the youth subculture as alcohol is part of the adult society. It is long past time when our laws should reflect this reality. It is hypocrisy to jail youngsters for five years for possession of marijuana while permitting men to make fortunes selling cancer in a cigarette pack.”

“We have raised our children to value the individual, but then ask them to be absorbed into giant bureaucracies which serve themselves before they serve the individual.

We have crowed about great achievements of our society, about our ability to get to the moon, about our money and our goods and our economic systems and they wonder why 15-million Americans go hungry.
