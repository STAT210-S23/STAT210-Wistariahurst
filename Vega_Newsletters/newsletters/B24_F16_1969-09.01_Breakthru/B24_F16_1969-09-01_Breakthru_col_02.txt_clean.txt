	A revamping of the Oracle has been in order. Breakthru is the product of these renovations. Our main policy is the same, to bring about constructive change. This paper belongs to no-one and owes nothing to anybody. It is a paper from the people. We want you to get involved, to be concerned about things happening for and against humanity, and finally to act. To do this we must be together remembering that our purpose must be constructive and fill a void rather than create one. Act positively if you disagree with the policies of a ruling body such as your city government and school administrations.

		Americans and South Vietnamese voted for peace… got war. Why?

			Soldiers show dissent in Vietnam base (BASE IKE).


	There were those on Fire Base Ike prone to keeping their heads down when the fighting began.
	There were the Vietnam veterans whose only concern was to get out alive. There were those who openly questioned whether all the fighting and dying was worth it.
	There were those who tried to escape the grim reality of Fire Base Ike with drugs. Just that day two junkies were shipped to the rear because their presence might endanger the others.
	And the dissenters talked every day about their doubts, thus threatening to undermine the fighting spirit that Lindsey felt he needed.
	There were those who were openly disobedient. A few days earlier 5 infantry men temporarily refused to man an overnight observation post because of the danger.
	Another soldier was sent back because he wouldn't fight.
	Another shot himself in the foot to get out.

STAND
For the things you know are right
It's the truth that the truth makes them so uptight
STAND
They will try to make you crawl
And they know what you're saying makes sense and all
STAND
Don't you know that you are free
Well at least in your mind if you want to be

				– Sylvester Stewart
