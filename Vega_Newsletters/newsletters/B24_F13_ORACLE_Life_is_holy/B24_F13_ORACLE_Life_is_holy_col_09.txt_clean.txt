					THE DICTATOR

	Freedom is the abstract idea we, in this country, hold so hypocritically to our hearts. Only in a dictatorship do leaders brainwash and control their people. Only under such governments do leaders tell their people what to believe. These people are easily tricked in their assemblies. Then the leader tells them what to do: clap - stand - sit - clap - bow - think - don't think - stand - clap - sit.
	Only brainwashed constituents are easily fed lies. Totally unaware of what is going on, these people are programmed-——told what to say and how to react.
	These dictators rule the body and soul of these fooled people. Their total environment is controlled, They are only players in a game, pawns only for the using, never for the receiving or giving of their intellectual capacity.

			Facism and Communism – One and the Same?

	The terms Fascism and Communism are often used loosely without proper recognition of their meaning. They are sometimes even used interchangeably.
	Fascism is on the extreme right, whereas communism is on the extreme left. Fascism advocates the Rights of the State, The Individual is merely a part of the whole. The rights of the individual are totally submerged in the interest of the State.
	In a communist society, however, the emphasis is placed on Human Rights. Ideally, the state will eventually dissolve.
	Fascists are Nationalistic. They believe in one Supreme Race which is destined to rule the world.
	Communists are Internationalistic. Karl Marx, in his Communist Manifesto, wrote,"Workers of the world, unite."
