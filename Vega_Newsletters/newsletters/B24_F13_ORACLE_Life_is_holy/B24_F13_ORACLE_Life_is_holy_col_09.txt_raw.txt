THE DICTATOR

Freedom is the abstract idea we, in this country, hold so hypo-
critically to our hearts, Only in a dictatorship do leaders brainwash
and control their people. Only uncer such governments do leaders tell
their people what to believe, These people are easily tricked in their
assemblies, Then the leader tells them what to do: clap - stand - sit -
clap - bow - think - don't think - stand - clap - sit.

Only brainwashed constituents are easily fed lies, Totally unaware
of what is going on, these people are programed-——told what to say and
how to react.

These dictators rule the body and soul of these fooled people.
Their total environment is controlled, They are only players ina
game, pavns only for the using, never for the receiving or giving of
their intellectual capacity.

Facism and Communism=~-One and the Same?

The terms Fascism and Communism are often used loosely without
proper recognition of their meaning. They are sometimes even used
interchangably.

Fascism is on the extreme right, whereas communism is on the
extreme left. Fascism advocates the Rights of the State, The Individ-
ual is merely a part of the whole, The rights of the individual are
totally submerged in the interest of the State.

In a communistic society,hovever, the emphasis is placed on Human
Rights. Ideally, the state will eventually dissolve.

Fascists are Nationalistic. hsy believe in one Supreme Race
which is destined to rule the vworls,

Communists are Internaticra ichic. Karl Marx, in his Communist
Manifesto, wrote,"Vorkers of the world, unite."
