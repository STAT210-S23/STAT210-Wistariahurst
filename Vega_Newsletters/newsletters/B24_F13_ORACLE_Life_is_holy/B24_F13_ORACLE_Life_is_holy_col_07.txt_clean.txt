	PAT'S SONG

Bring flowers and bring then
round her grass hair.
Bring leaves from the Mountain
and boxes of air.
Bring baskets of food
and things you can share
and the moon will shine in
her eyes.

She will stand and see with
her body like sand
and the dolphins will come
kiss the palms of her hand
as she opens her soul to the
water and land
Her smiles will cover the sky.

With bottles of light
and sacks of clay
with music to dance and songs
to play
with lemons and candles
you'll see the way
that the moon will shine in
her eyes.

She will fly on the wind
with her face to the sun.
Children will dance all
around her for fun.
Just ask her for love
and she'll give you some
for her smile will cover
the sky.

- Country Joe MacDonald
