THE DRAFT: Part V

	After World War II, only two countries were militarily and economically able to occupy and dictate policy to another country- they were the United States and the Soviet Union. It was inevitable that these two powers would clash. The U.S adopted three basic policies aimed at the containment of the Soviet Union. The first was the military occupation of Western Europe and Japan. The second was the economic strengthening of these two areas to obtain effective allies. The third was the establishment of a network of military alliances.
	In order to supply men for this massive program, peacetime conscription was needed. It was established in March, 1948 after the Soviet Union seized the government of Czechoslovakia.
	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the first in a series of Post WWII alliances dependent upon U.S. Conscription. Then came the Baghdad pact (CENTO), the U.S. Japanese Defense Treaty of 1951, and then SEATO.
	Because of these and other agreements, the U.S. has been able to establish strong military footholds in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. These “commitments” make peacetime conscription necessary so that we can maintain the role of world policemen.
	By means of peacetime conscription, the President and the Pentagon have been able to send troops virtually anywhere and even enter war without securing the constitutional sanctions of Congress or the popular support of the people.
