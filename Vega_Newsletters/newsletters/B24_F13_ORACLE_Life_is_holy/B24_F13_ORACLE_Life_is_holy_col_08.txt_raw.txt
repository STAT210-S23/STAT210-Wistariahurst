With the knowledge that the news of what is happening in the movement
seldom reaches the public through the established news media, we will
attempt to fill this vacuum by reporting the important causes and
events of the underground.

the GRAPE STRIKE; the average wage of a farm worker in 6alifornia
is $1.62. At the peak of the grape season some grape
workers carn $2.00 per hour, but consider what a small
minority the grape pickers are. This strike which was
started and is centered around the grape picker is also
a strike for the benefit of all farm workers. Since
grape picking is a seasonal job the average wage is
$1600 to $2300 per years
