Att. ORACLE Staff:
	We of the West Street School Project would like to express our appreciation for your generous gift. It will be useful in providing much needed equipment and as we have been operating on the strained budget of the Service Club we were greatly relieved. Thank you again.

	A little girl asked her mother, “Do you and Daddy have sexual relations?” Thinking it was a good time to discuss a few facts of life, the mother replied, “Of course we do, dear.”
	Then how come, asked the youngster, “I never got to meet any of them?"
	We are happy that you enjoyed, and will continue to enjoy, our presentation of Spring. We will bless you with sunshine, happiness, flowers, and a little rain. In the coming months, be sure to watch for our presentation of summer.
