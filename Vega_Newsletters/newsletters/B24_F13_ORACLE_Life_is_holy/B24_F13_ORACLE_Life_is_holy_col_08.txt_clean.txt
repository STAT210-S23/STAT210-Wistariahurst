With the knowledge that the news of what is happening in the movement seldom reaches the public through the established news media, we will attempt to fill this vacuum by reporting the important causes and events of the underground.

	the GRAPE STRIKE: the average wage of a farm worker in California is $1.62. At the peak of 	the grape season some grape workers earn $2.00 per hour, but consider what a small minority 	the grape pickers are. This strike which was started and is centered around the grape picker 	is also a strike for the benefit of all farm workers. Since grape picking is a seasonal job 	the average wage is $1600 to $2300 per year.

	LOWERING THE VOTING AGE TO 18: twelve million young adults in their twentieth, nineteenth, 	and eighteenth years who function as other American adults do under most of our laws are 	barred from voting. Several million young men and women 18 to 21 years old have established 	homes and families but have no voice in the issues at city hall, the courthouse, or the 	capitol. Millions of young Americans work and support themselves but have no voice in
	the laws that govern them and their work.
	“Taxation without representation is tyranny." Young adults pay heavily in sales, use, 		gasoline and income tax. Servicemen and women are also not allowed to vote if under 21. All 	College and University students under 21 cannot vote.
	Make your views known to your U.S. senators and congressmen and state legislators.
