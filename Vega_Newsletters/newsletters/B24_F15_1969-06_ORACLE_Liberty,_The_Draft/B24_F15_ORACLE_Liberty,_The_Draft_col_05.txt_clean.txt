ORACLE staff;

	Have read some of your issues and am pleased with what you are doing. The problems you discuss and the questions you ask are those which definitely SHOULD be presented at the high school level. If the only way these topics can be acknowledged is via an underground paper, then more power to you. It is amazing to look back and see how unaware I was, and my class as a whole was when we were in high school. At this stage, you are a lot more “educated” – in the true sense of the word - than we were.
	I thought I'd write this letter because I know how people tend to put down high school students simply because they are high school students. Sometimes it helps if it is known that
you have the support and respect of people who are older, if not quite ancient yet. Keep up the good work.

								Sincerely,
								Mike O’Connor

								H.H.S. Class of 1964

				‘COLD-BLOODED MURDER’

	He was black, and that may have been enough. On the night of April 19, 24-year-old Roosevelt Jackson was shot to death by the white assistant chief of police in Port Gilson, Miss. Witnesses say Jackson was shot in the stomach, while the cop, Jesse L Wolf, held his arm.	
	“It was cold-blooded murder,” Charles Evers of the NAACP said. “If they let him (WOLF) go, we are going to close this town down and turn it back to the Indians." Charged with murder, Wolf has been released on $5000 bond.
