When I've got Something to Say Sir

Oh I am just a student, sir
And I only want to learn.
But it’s hard to read, through
the rising smoke of the books
that you'd like to burn.
So I’d like to make a promise
I’d like to make a vow
(REFRAIN)
That when I’ve got something to
say, Sir, I'm gonna say it now!

I wish that you'd make up your mind,
I wish that you'd decide,
That we should live as freely,
as those that live outside,
Cause we are all entitled
To the rights to be endowed.

(Refrain)
So keep right on a talkin’
and tell us what to do,
But if nobody listens,
My apologies to you.
I know that you were younger once.
Cause you sure are older now!

And when I’ve got something to say,
Sir, I'm going to say it now!

Up on thousand project hill
it’s either fortune or fame –
you must pick one or the other –
though neither of them are what 
they claim.

…how many years can some people exist before they are allowed to be free…. how many deaths will it take before he knows that too many people have died?

Bracero

Wade into the river,
through the rippling shallow water,
still across the thirsty border,
through Bracero.
Come bring your hungry body,.
to the golden fields of plenty,
from a peso to a penny,
through Bracero.
(Refrain)
Oh Welcome to California! (Where :
the friendly farmers will take
care of you!)

Come labor for your mother
for your father and your brother
for your sister and your lover -
through Bracero
Come pick the fruits of yellow
Bring the flowers from the berries
Purple grapes will fill your bellies
through Bracero.
(Refrain)
In the shade of your sombrero,
drop your sweat upon the soil
like the fruit your youth can spoil
through Bracero
As the sun will hide your body,
As the dust will dry your thirsty
As your muscles beg for mercy
through Bracero.
(Refrain)
When the weary night embraces
sleep in shacks that could be cages
they will take it from your wages
through Bracero
Come sing about tomorrow
With the jingle of the dollars
and forget your crooked collars
through Bracero.
(Refrain)
