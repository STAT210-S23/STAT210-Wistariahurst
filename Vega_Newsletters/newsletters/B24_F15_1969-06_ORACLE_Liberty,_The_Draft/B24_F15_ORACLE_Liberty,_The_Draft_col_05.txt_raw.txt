New York, Net
: May 19,1969
OBACLE staff;
Have read some of your issues and am pleased with what
you are doing. The problems you discuss and the questions you ask
are those which definitly SHOULD be presented at the high school
level. If the only*these topics can be acknowledged is via an
underground paper, then more power to you. It is amazing to look
back and see how unaware I was, and my class as a whole was when
we were in high school, At this stage, you are a lot more ;
‘educated - in the true sense of the word - than We weree :
I thought I'd write this letter because I know how
people tend to put down high school students simply because they are
high schools students. Sometimes it helps if it is known that
you have the support and respect of people who are older, if
not quite ancient yet. Keep up the good work,
Sincerely,
Mike O*Connor
President
H.H.S. Class of 1964

He was black, and that may have been enough. On the night of April
19, 24-year-old Roosevelt Jackson was shot to death by the white ass-
istant chief of police in Port Gilson, Miss, Witnesses say Jackson
was shot in the stomach, while the cop, Jesse L Wolf, held his arm,
“It was cold-blooded murder,” Charles Evers of the NAACP said.
“Ig they let him (WOLF) go, we are going to close this town down and
turn it back to the Indians." Charged with murder, Wolf has been
released on $5000 bond,
