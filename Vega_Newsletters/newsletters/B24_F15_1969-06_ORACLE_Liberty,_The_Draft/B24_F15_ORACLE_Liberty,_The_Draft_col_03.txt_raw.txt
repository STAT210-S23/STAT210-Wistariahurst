THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE AGAINST Til FLAG
The dogs are chasing chicken bombs across the lawn,
If that was an election, I'm a Viet Cong,
So I pledge allegiance against the flag
and the Bomb for which it stands,
I°llL raze it if I can.

FACTION OF HHS RECEIVES OCHS AWARD
The liberals-radicals-revolutionaries of Holyoke Hich School have
been officially declared the winners of the First Annual Ochs Award,
The Ochs Award honors singer Phil Ochs, the author of The Pledge
of Allegiance Against the Flag. It was written as part of the song

“Another Age* contained on his just released A&M album ‘Rehearsals For

Retirement,“

A certain group of people at Holyoke High School has been awarded

The Ochs Award for these reasons:

1) The publishing of a liberated student newspaper--first Free Purple,
then aftcr its death, The Oracle--newspapers free from administra-
tive control-censorship~-bringing out relevant issues to the students
of HHS,

2) Attempting to change outdated rules--gaining a majority signature
on a petition showing dissatisfaction with the present dress code--
working on a committee that is now looking into the revision and
possible abolishment of the dress code.

3) Gaining The Hill--one of the driving forces behind our gaining The
Hill for use during recess was the fact that, before permission was
granted, several dozen students broke school rules by going out onto
The Hill--after a few days of this action, permission to use The
Hill was granted.

4) Informing the rest of the school about the grape boycott-~concerned
students have put up posters and put on an assembly supporting the
grape pickers in California--an act of love and compassion shown
for these oppressed workers.

5) Aiding minotty groups--certain students gave time and effort to
help Puerto Rican children learn the English language--in order for
them to become involved and liberate themselves, they must learn the :
language.
