Bracero
Wade into the river,
through the rippling shallow water,
still across the thirsy bordez,
through Bracero,
Come bring your hungry body,.
to the golden fields of plenty,
from a paeso to a penny,
through Braceroe
(Refrain)
Oh Welcome to California! (Where :
|, bhe friendly farmers will take
care of you!)
Come labor for your mother
for your father and your brother
for your sister and your lower -
through Bracero
Come pick the fruits of yellow
Bring the flowers from the berries
Purple grapes will fill your bellies
through Bracero,
Refrain
In the shade of your sombraro,
drop your sweat upon the soil
like the fruit your youth can spoil
through Bracero
As the sun will hide your body,
As the dust will dry your thirsty
As your muscles bes for mercy
through Bracero.
Refrain
When the weary night embraces
sleep in shacks that could be cages
they will take it from your wages
through Bracero
Come sing about tomorrow
With the jingle of the dollars
and forget your crooked collars
through Bracero. :
Refrain
Phil Ochs
