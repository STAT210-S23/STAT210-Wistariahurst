INTERLACING FINGERS

Interlacing fingers
Grasp my unwilling brain
With electric holds like lightning
The electrocuted, the softly falling
rain

These interlacing fingers 
Are trying to twist my mind 
With adult charades and play 
That have been staged all through
time 

These interlacing fingers 
Are angry frustrated with hurt 
"How can we do this“ they cry
Pot, long hair, acid, and mini-
skirts

These interlacing fingers 
Are slowly losing their hold
We will overcome their old ideas 
A new history will be told

These interlacing fingers 
Have given up the fight 
They can finally see through
diseased minds
They finally know we are right 

These interlacing fingers
Are gone forever now
I walk with peace and love
And to no one will I bow.

CREED

Superficial morning of a
Superficial day
Open up your eyelids
in a superficial way
Stare with solar wonder
as the sun begins to rise
Hate your own black brother
For the color you despise

Just agree with everyone
Stress not pro or con
Your hypercritical viewpoints
And your artificial smile you don

Worship God each Sunday
But by Monday you reject
All the Godly teachings
Of this godly sect

Close your eyes to evil
The sham and drudgery you must 
not see
Open your virgin eyes
And face – reality?

IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT YOU WEAR TO CLASS IT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN CLASS THAT COUNTS

Well the moral of this story
The moral of this song *
Is simply that one should never be 
where one does not belong
— So if you see your neighbor
carrying something 
Help him with his load 
And don’t go mistaking Paradise
for that home across the road 

(*Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judus Priest) - Dylan
