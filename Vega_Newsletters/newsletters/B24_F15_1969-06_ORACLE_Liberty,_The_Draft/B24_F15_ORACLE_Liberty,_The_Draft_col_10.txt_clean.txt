Drugs in the Movement

	Drugs. This seems to be a great hang-up with many people. Today there seems to be a great increase in drugs, the highlighted one being pot. If you get right down to it they are no big thing. Anybody can do that thing, like wow.
	For many black people drugs are used as an escape method. An escape from reality. They want to get away from the frustrations and problems that plague and lead their lives. Many of the black people on drugs are young and potential black men women. Have you ever seen a 12 year old junkie? It's a terrible thing. We as a group of people have to get ourselves together and drugs are one of our hang-ups. It is a beautiful feeling to get high granted, but when the shit goes down is being high going to help? Hell no! A great majority of black drug users do not realize this either. We all know whitey controls everything and in his control are drugs also. He knows black people in our major cities are easy prey and he goes in warping minds and exploiting our people.
	The thing now is what can be done. This is not an easy problem and I don't know the solution. I hope that any black brother or sister who reads this takes this as a plea to please try and get away from this thing. The only thing drugs really do in the end is screw you up! This is what
whitey wants and he knows you are vulnerable.
	If you sisters and brothers really want to get yourselves together you have to give this thing up. If you want to talk to someone get in touch with me and I will send you to black people who have experienced this shit. Remember time is running out!

Dick Gregory asks you to:

stop shaving,
stop buying cigarettes
stop getting your hair cut
stop buying dress clothes

ALL UNTIL THE WAR IN VIETNAM IS OVER AND TROOPS ARE BROUGHT HOME

***************************************************************************************************

Light yourself a candle, don’t wear
sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don’t want to be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don’t work
‘Cause the vandals took the handles


Look out kid, you’re gonna get hit
But users, cheaters
Six times losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Looking for a new fool
Don’t follow leaders
Watch the parkin’ meters
