When I've got Something to Say Sir
i Oh I am just a student, sir
And I only want to learn.
But it’s hard to read, through
the rising smoke of the books
that you'd like to burn.
So I’d like to make a promise
I°d like to make a vow
(REF AAIN§
That when I’ve got something to
say, Sir, I'm gonna say it nowt
I wish that you'd make up your mind,
I wish that you'd decide,
That we should live as freely,
as those that live outside,
Cause we are all entitled
To the rights to be endowed.
(Refrain)
So keep right on a talkin’
and tell us what to do,
But if nobody listens,
My apoligies to you.
I know that you were younger once.
Cause you sure are older now!
And when I’ve got something to say,
Sir, I'm going to say it now!
