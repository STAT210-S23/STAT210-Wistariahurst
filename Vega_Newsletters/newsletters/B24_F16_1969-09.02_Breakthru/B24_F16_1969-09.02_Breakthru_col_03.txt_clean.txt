	Many Holyoke citizens have heard this call and are actively participating in the October Mass
Pac. Most notably the students and faculty of the Community College are working for it. A march, leafleting, and showing of films are anticipated to heighten the entire day. A schedule of events will probably be published.
	The students and faculty can participate due to a vote to suspend classes (if a teacher so desires he may hold classes). Students are not being forced into going - but hopefully all the students in our city who have a desire to see the war end will be there.
	Even though there will be great crowds, the faces of high school students will greatly be missed. For the School Committee, as of this writing, has not said a word concerning the closing of
the High school. Nor has the clergy said a word about closing Holyoke Catholic High. We feel this to be a mistake. Many High School students are eligible for the draft and it is only fair that if
they feel strongly against this war that they be allowed to show their dissent.
	Time is limited for high school students to organize for Oct 15. Overwhelming chances have it
that neither High schools will be closed. But this doesn't mean that High School students can't contribute! Talk about the war in all your classes, wear black armbands, in opposition to the war.
	Have a moment of silence. And if you so desire go to the college and try to pick up material to pass round in your school.
