				October 15 is Vietnam Peace Action Day.

	The most important task facing the United States of America is ending the war in Vietnam. This war continues to have a corrupting influence on every aspect of American life. The United States entered Vietnam by Presidential decision; the United States can withdraw from Vietnam by Presidential decision. We call for a firm commitment from President Nixon to withdraw ALL American troops within six months.
	We declare October 15 the first VIETNAM PEACE ACTION DAY. On that day we shall observe a moratorium on all business-as-usual. We shall refrain from regular economic academic research and other ordinary activities and spend the entire day working in local communities for peace in Vietnam.
	If a satisfactory Presidential response is not given the second VIETNAM PEACE ACTION will be conducted on the two days of November 13 and 14. This pattern will continue monthly until there is a commitment for complete American withdrawal.
