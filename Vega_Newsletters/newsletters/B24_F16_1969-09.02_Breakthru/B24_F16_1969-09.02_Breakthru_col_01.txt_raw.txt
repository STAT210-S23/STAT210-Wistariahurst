According to Dr. James E. Teele, a sociologist at
Harvard School of Public Health, , the percentage
of illegitimate births in Boston has almost
doubled in a recent three-year period (and the
rise cannot be attributed to the blacks). This

is a shameful indictment against many of our short
sighted legislators who continue to blindly find
sin in the Pill and Birth control information.
