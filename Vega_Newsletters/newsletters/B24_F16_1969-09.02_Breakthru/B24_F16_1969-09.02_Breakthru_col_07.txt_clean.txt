				MUSIC: A LOCAl SUMMER REVIEW
			   The Contemporary Trend Series at Lenox

	Tanglewood's initial concert started rather badly with the disappointing performance of Orpheus. Hampered by equipment trouble and an unbalanced sound, the only appreciable numbers were
written and recorded by the group themselves.
	But then the amazing Janis Joplin quickly brought the audience back to life. Her charismatic effect was due mainly to her original gutsy blues voice, besides the fact that she used
every available faculty to transmit her meaning to the audience. The definite heights of the concert were the performances of "Summertime" and “Piece of my Heart", sending everyone to
their feet in acclaim.
	Each week became more intense than the previous proven at the concert featuring the Staple Singers and the Iron Butterfly.
	A good performance was given by the Negro spiritual orientated Staple Singers, arousing the audience enough to be called back for an encore.
	Then, with the familiar strain of "2001: A Space Odyssey," penetrating over the P.A. system, the Iron Butterfly dramatically began their performance with a hard hitting song entitled, "Are You Happy?" The group then proceeded to play songs off all of their hit albums, among them being the long version of their latest single, “In the Time of Our Lives," and their highly anticipated theme, "In-a-Godda-Da-Vida." The outstanding baritone voice of organist Doug Ingle was only matched by the heavy drum solo performed by Ron Bushy, bringing the people to their feet and rushing down the aisles, not to be seated or controlled for the rest of the evening.
	The climax of the entire series was the night Bill Graham's Fillmore ensemble came to the music shed, complete with the Jefferson Airplane, B.B. King, the Who, and the Joshua Light Show.
	It all began with veteran blues guitarist B.B. King and his fabulous backup band giving a show warranting two encores.
