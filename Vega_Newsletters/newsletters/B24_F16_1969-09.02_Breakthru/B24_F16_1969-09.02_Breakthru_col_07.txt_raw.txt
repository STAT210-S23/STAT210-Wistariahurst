JERRY and DICK BUILD A PARK

There is an almost finished sculptured play-
ground in Ward one (29 North East Street) which is
very interesting and might prove a worthwhile
place to visit.

The playground was built over the summer by
area freaks and children from the flats area.

Jerry Wyman of the Art Department at HCC con-
ceived the idea for the project last winter. He
bartered with city officials for land and materials
and was helped in his efforts by Mayor Taupier.

He and Dick Dubue began work in June and
gradually accumulated an enthusiastic if inept
work force. Donations by local businesses and con-
struction firms greatly increased the scope of the
project which relied chiefly on funds from Hike
for Holyoke.

The result is a unique and interesting coll-
ection of creative fun aparatus. It would be in-
correct to say that the only result of the project
was the physical playground sculptures.

The project served to involve the builders in
the community at many levels. It was an act of
constructive revolution. It was an educational
process. It was a continuing process of involve-
ment in human concerns. It was probably one of the
best things that ever happened. So maybe yot’d
like to find time to go look at it.
