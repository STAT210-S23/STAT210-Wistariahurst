on the DRESS CODE in high schools
Long hairs may temporarly rejoice in the re=
cent Boston court ruling in that the high school
administrations cannot dismiss them for their hair
styles. But one must remember that most cases of
this type are subject to appesl] as is being done
with this one. If reverced, things could go right
back to"normal", Therefore, the only recourse
for HOlyoke High is to pressure the school committee
to abolish the entire dress code.
MEETINGS ARE BEING HELD EVERY WEDNESDAY EVENING AT
8 PM AT HOPE CHURCH, PLANS FOR AN AREA HIGH
SCHOOL CONVENTION WILL BE DISCUSSED. THE MEET-
INGS ARE AT SPRINGFIELD.

CAMPAIGN TO STEP UP
GOVERNMENT ACTION
As the population flood inundates the world time
runs out at a frightening speed, Every week over
a million more people are added to the human
family. The United States Government should
forthwith inaugurate a crash program to deal with
the population problem in proportion to its mag-
nitude. A Government that spends billions of dol-
lars to feed hungry people, who in turn will pro-
duce more hungry people, should at least spend
hundreds of millions to stem the flood!
A group of citizens concerned with the prob-
Jem has organized and financed a Campaign to
Check the Population Explosion. They are ap-
pealing to the Government to implement the
statements of the President. To this end they will
use advertisements, news and other media to
state the case. They will also appeal for coopera-
tion of citizens in all walks of American life who
share their view.
