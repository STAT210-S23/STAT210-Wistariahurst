				JERRY and DICK BUILD A PARK

	There is an almost finished sculptured playground in Ward one (29 North East Street) which is very interesting and might prove a worthwhile place to visit.
	The playground was built over the summer by area freaks and children from the flats area.
	Jerry Wyman of the Art Department at HCC conceived the idea for the project last winter. He bartered with city officials for land and materials and was helped in his efforts by Mayor Taupier.
	He and Dick Dubue began work in June and gradually accumulated an enthusiastic if inept
work force. Donations by local businesses and construction firms greatly increased the scope of the project which relied chiefly on funds from Hike for Holyoke.
	The result is a unique and interesting collection of creative fun apparatus. It would be incorrect to say that the only result of the project was the physical playground sculptures.
	The project served to involve the builders in the community at many levels. It was an act of constructive revolution. It was an educational process. It was a continuing process of involvement in human concerns. It was probably one of the best things that ever happened. So maybe you'd like to find time to go look at it.
