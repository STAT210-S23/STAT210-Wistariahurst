According to Dr. James E. Teele, a sociologist at Harvard School of Public Health, the percentage of illegitimate births in Boston has almost doubled in a recent three-year period (and the
rise cannot be attributed to the blacks). This is a shameful indictment against many of our short sighted legislators who continue to blindly find sin in the Pill and Birth control information.

"The system in general and the Nixon administration in particular must respond to the American crisis
or we will do it our way ourselves... This is not a threat; it is a warning... This is your last chance to prove yourself to our generation."
