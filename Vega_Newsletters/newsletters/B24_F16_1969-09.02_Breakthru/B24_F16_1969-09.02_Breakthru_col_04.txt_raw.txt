Many Holyoke citizens have heard this call
and are activally participating in the â€˜October Mass
Pac. Most notably the students and faculity of
the Community College are working for it. A marche
leafleting,and showing of films are anticipated to
highten the entire day. A schedule of events will
probably be published,

The students and faculity can particapte due
to a vote to suspend classes (if a teacher so dee
sires he may hold classes), Students are not being
forces into going - but hopefully all the students
in our city who have a desire to see the war end
willbe there.

Even though there will be great crowds the
faces of high school students will greatly be
missed. For the School Committee, as of this writ-
ing, has not said a word concerning the closing of
the High school. Nor has the clergy said a word
about closing Holyoke Catholic High. We feel this
to be a mistake. Many High School students are
eligible for the draft and it is only fair that if
they fe@l strongly against this war that they be
allowed to show their dissent.

Time is limited for high school students to
organize for Oct 15, Overwhelming chances have it
that neither High schools will be closed. But this
doesn't mean that High School students can't cont-
ribute! Talk about the war in all your classes,
Wear black arm bands, inopposition to the war.

Have a moment of silence. And if you so desire go
to the college and try to pick up material to pass

a) FOUnd in your school.
