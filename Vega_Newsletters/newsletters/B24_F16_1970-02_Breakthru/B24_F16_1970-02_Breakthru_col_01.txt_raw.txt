There are ninety and mine whe dive and die

Im want and hunger and celd

That ome may live in luxury

dad be wrapped im a silken feld

The ninety and nime in hevels bare

The ene in apalace with riches rare

And the one owns cities and houses and land

And the ninety and nine have empty hands
Farmer's Alliance,1689
