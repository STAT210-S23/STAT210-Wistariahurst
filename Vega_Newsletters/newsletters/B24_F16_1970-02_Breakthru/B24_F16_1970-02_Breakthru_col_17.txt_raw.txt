unto your self. You are taught by senseless outrage
to save yoursel? from torture at the hands of the
blood seeking public, who has placed genocide on you.
Save your race from insult and shame, Be your own
sheriff, court, and jury, if necessary like an out-
law. Die in your tracks. Dr. King's charity, humanity
and advice of forgiveness, and so on,will never be
reciprocated by White societies. I wish I knew how
it would feel to be free, for freely would I give
wy life if it would insure my children freedom. Black
people at last have taken an attitude of defiance
toward the White man who calls himself your friend.
Ask yourself how has he manifested his friendship.
By hanging you, by making you do his menial work and
use his back door for jobs, refuding you employment.
The only front positions the White man has ever given
you - is in battle.When you return home you can't use
the sidewalks--you use the roats. I see my Black
brothers and sisters praying, but I don't know WHY?
God must be a "White" man considering the way he
treats us. No doubt there will be a “Jim Crow" law
in heaven when we can get there. That's why I can't
sing "Sweet Land of Liberty." I can't sing 1t because
I kmow it's not true.
You who are Black, you should teach yourself to
think Black. If you stop and think White for a second
you are a traitor to me, It’s unnatural that a man
any man, should think in color. But in this everything
White world, you must, THINK BLACK.
("Just because you're in this country doesn't make
you an American, No, you've got to get farther than
that before you can become an American. You've got
yo enjoy the fruits of Americanism. You haven't en-
Joyed those fruits. You've enjoyed the thorns. You've
enjoyed the thistles. But you have not enjoyed the
fruits, no str. You have fought harder for the fruits
than the White man has, but you've enjoyed less.)
--Malcolm X
That's why I say I am not an American, but a victim
of Americanism,
