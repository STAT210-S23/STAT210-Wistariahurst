confronted by adults who don't dig you, maybe they
didn't 1iké our looks, you may sound like you don’t
know anything. Oh! and yes one more thing I did not
state that the Transcript did not carry articles con-
cerning the Draft. The reporter was obviously not
listening. Was she busily reading BREAKTHRU?

I stated that the Transcript did not print articles
really revelent to what is going on ( they bury

the Chicago trial, most Black Panther,and and Black
militant , Rap Brown, news items somewhere in the
back page under tons of ads). We will try and bring
items liké the Draft closer to the people in the city
that are affected by it.
