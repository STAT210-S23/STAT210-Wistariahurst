Who are the oppressors? The few: the king, the
capitalist and a handful of other overseers and
superintendents. Who are the oppressed?’ The many:
the nations of the earth ; the valuable person—
ages; the workers; they that make the bread that
the soft-handed and idle eat. Why is it right
that there is not a fairer division of the spoil
ell around? Because laws and constitutions have
ordered otherwise. Then it follows that laws and-
constitutions should change around and say there
shall be more nearly equal division.

Mark Twain 1886
