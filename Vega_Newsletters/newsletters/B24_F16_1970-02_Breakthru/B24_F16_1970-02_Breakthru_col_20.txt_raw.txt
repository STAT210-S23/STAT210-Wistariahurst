I was rappin‘ with some guys about the’ United
States peeltton en defense, Our President

ig a Quaker, but he's no pacifist! In the way

Mr. N. hides behind his bombs and rockets

you'd think he was chicken, 4.B.M. is to keep
intact Anerica's first strike @¥fteck, But,

between the U.S. and the viets, ee openers
have enough atomic weapons to wipe out 40 EARTHS!
4n Air Force Officer told me we had to “Keep. in-
creasing our power to be equal with our enemies,
eventhough we'll. never use it.% WHAT ARE WE DOING?
We have built the better dcoms-day Machine and
now we want to perfect it! Nixon wants peace but
would you trust a man who says he wants to be your
friend (you've been bittar enemies for

years) and as he-s talkin’ to you,you. see his

son loading a brand new hunting rifle}: would you
trust him?

Mr. Nixon is about to state that he is in favor
of building a new fleet of bombers to replace the
B-52. (1) The replacement of marihd bombers was
dropped by Johngon because it's inad@quate (2)
Two replacement bombers were found and both were
built. tne, the B58,is gone out of production with
only a hand full of planes to be seen. fhe second
Billion doller ABORTION, the B/G, as it was to be
called, better known as the RXB70,1t was built at
the cost of Billions and only one was finally
fit for flight, and at this it FLEW LESS THAN
HALF & DOZEN TIMES, But Mr. Nixon can't find money
to help the poor, but he can make his rich friends
at Boeing richer! are you dust going to let him
do this? GZ Rospost on
