E THERE /EB /0,
entirely on three students, with no supporting
evidnece at all. The three were supposedly
faced with a iibel lawsuit, made public by
the principal. Tyis was a lie, there was no
libel in it, and there was no chance at all
of a libel lawsuit. The principal also stated
in front of the student body the school board
would be present in school the next week,
this was anotherlie, they never showed. up.

Yet two schooh days later the same three accus.
ed students were excluded for no reason.

The school is breaking laws, denying freedom o:
speech guaranteed in the constitution

and ruining many kids' life for no reason.

We the students must band together and stop
this misjustice immediately. We must show

the schools we are people not shit.
