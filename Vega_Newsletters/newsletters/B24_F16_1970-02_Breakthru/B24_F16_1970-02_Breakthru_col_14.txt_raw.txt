The School in their decision stated that they
did not allow publications to be sold in the
High School. What, may we ash, is sold at the
bookstore at the High School? ARE these not
publications? The only time people in power
enforce a law is when it suites their needs!
What is the School Committee WORRIED about?
Are they afraid of what High School Kids
would do if they learned of RACISM, and the
POWER Structure here in Holyoke! In the
country!

IS NOT THE High School an Educational in-
stitution? Arn't we guarenteed the freedom of
SPEECH? the freedom OF the PRESS? Or does our
AGE EXCLUDE US FROM CONSTITUTIONAL GUARENTEES??
