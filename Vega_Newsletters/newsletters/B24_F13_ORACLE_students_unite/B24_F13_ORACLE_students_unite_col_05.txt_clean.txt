	In 1940, when France fell to the Germans, tie French Government
capitulated in favor of the Vichy Government under Marshall Pétain.

	On the day after France signed the Armistice with Germany,
General Charles de Gaulle announced the formation of a French National
Committee pledged to the continuation of the war. He set up a Government
-in-Exile in London. In doing this, de Gaulle was denouncing the
legitimate government of his country. He claimed that he had the
right to do this because he was representing the desires of the people
of France. By his actions, he is saying that if a government goes
against, or betrays the wants of the people, another government should
be set up. 

	The United States Declaration of Independence states that
if a government violates the rights of man, he not only has the
right, but the obligation to overthrow that government and set up
one more desirable to the people.

			About War--

	I've done a lot of thinking about “the war." (I guess you could
call it dreaming). I'm on neither the pro nor con of any war. It's
a rotten way of settling things and always has been. The trouble is,
people are too damn stubborn. They don't apply logic at all and are
tremendously selfish. If only all people- ALL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE -
could be more giving and try for once to do some good for someone
else or for some other country, instead of thinking only of them-
selves, we might have a little of this "peace" that I hear everyone
talking about,

	A dream?-yes, that's certainly what it is. To come true?-No,
I doubt it. People just weren't meant to be that way. So I guess
there'll always be selfishness, jealousy, stubbornness, and war.
