	In continuing with our policy of suggesting reforms, we bring
you part two.

	The intelligence of a student is often brought forth by a good
teacher. A poor teacher, however, can stifle any spark of intelligence
or creativity in a child.

	A poor teacher, often on elderly one, is a waste of the students
time. The teacher who sits at his desk and spends the year reading to
his students benefits no one, and often creates a feeling of hostility
and frustration on the part of the class:

	The excellent teacher, on the other hand, who urges his students
to think, to create, who shows that learning does not have to be a dull,
slow process, is seldom confronted with undisciplined students or 
students who fall asleep at their desks.

	Undoubtedly. a good teacher is more difficult to find, but, the
work of one good teacher is more valuable than the work of twenty
dull, uninspired teachers. .

	Students don’t generally object to working if he feels the work
is worth while. He does object to writing out the questions and
answers at the end of the chapter.
	
	A system should be set up to filter out the poor teachers--
for the benefit of the students.

	If students complain to the office about a specific teacher,
a Guidance Counselor should take it upon himself to sit in on a
few classes to determine whether the complaint is legitimate,

	The staff of the ORACLE believes that the idea of tenure should
be abolished, and laws protecting ALL teachers from being fired for
liberal teaching methods and liberal ideas should be set up. As it
now stands, new teachers are afraid to “stray from the beaten path"
for fear of their job. Older teachers, on the other hand, are sure of
their jobs and grow lax.
