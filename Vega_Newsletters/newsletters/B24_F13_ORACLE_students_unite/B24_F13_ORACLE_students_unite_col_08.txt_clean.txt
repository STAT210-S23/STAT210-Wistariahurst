Censorship cont.

the sales of this type of literature, but it will die down to the point
of placing a great number of "dirty" magazines out of business. Half
the reason people buy these is because they are illegal and are frowned
upon.

TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF WHEW YOU
DANCE
There will come a time when every-
	body
Who is lonely will be free...
TO SONG & DANCE & LOVE
There will come a time when every
	evil
That we know will be an evil
THAT WE CAN RISE ABOVE
Who cares if hair is long or short
Or sprayed or partly grayed
WE KNOW THAT HATE AIN'T
WHERE IT'S AT
(there will come a time when you
	won't
even be ashamed if you are fat!)
WAH WAH. VAH WAH
There will come a time when every-
	body
Who is lonely will be free 
TO SING & DANCE & LOVE (dance and
	love)
There will come a time when every
	evil
That we know will be an evil
THAT WE CAN RISE ABOVE (rise above)
Who cares if you're so poor you
	can't afford
To buy a pair of Mad A Go-Go
stretch elastic pants
THERE WILL COME A TIME
WHEN YOU CAN EVEN
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF WHEN
YOU DANCE
