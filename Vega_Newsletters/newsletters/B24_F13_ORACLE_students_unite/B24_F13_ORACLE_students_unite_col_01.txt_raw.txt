EDILOKIAL

In theo pist yetr miny hich school students hove begun to reclize
whet this world is like,the injustices inflictcd on man by his own
brothers. In growing ww84re, they hove bocone :ctive in denouncing
their invwd-quite administrstive he ds . They wint 1 voice in the
forming of school policies. They are tired of pupnet student rovern-
ments. The adninistration’s imnor nce ‘nd stubborness breed these
revolts.

Underground o tpers, lik this “nd come more rodice.1l, hve
sprunz from one pirt of this country to the other in hizth schrols.
Why? Dissotisfaction with t e rules tht try to rerul:te our lives,

bodies, “nd souls; awaroness of the milfunctioning courses und toxchers
thnt in no wiry serve our nerd of prepuring us for the world; dress
codes wnich hive nothing to so with the institution's business--
educition.

This assault on the white power structureis being carried
out from two fronts: the white radicnrls ond rovolutionirys coming
from “middle* class families who are secking a new mold of life, nd
the blick militants who seek their share of the ‘good life thot
this country's technolocice.l adv-neement cn provide. Both parties
have gonls, ond different f-ctions within e:ch movement might hve
different solutions for solving problems, but they voth seek chance
ead both sre williny to fight and die for it.

Most of the BLACK militents are together in their strive against
‘“whitey*., This is not true in the white redicnl movement. The
blacks are full time revolutionarics while many whites are willing
to throw a few bricks through windows thengo home 1nd listen to music.
These whites must org:nize md join forces with the blocks,

The trouble with this high school is that you veople .re not
together, You don't cure whit is heppening--you are plistic--youwerr
