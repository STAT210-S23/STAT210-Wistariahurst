SMOTHERS BROTHERS CANC#LLED

The Smothers Brothers vs. CBS fight over taste and censorship has
ended. Friday, the Columbia Broadcasting System announced the cancell-
ation of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour for next season. ~

The president of CBS-TV, Robert Wood, said the Smothers Brothers
had consistently failed to deliver tapes of the program to the network
in time for review by network executives and local stations.

The real reason one of TV's favorite shows was dumped was because
the Suothers Brothers told the truth and CBS was afraid to show it, An-
other factor was the pressure exerted on TV networks by the Government
to self-censor their shows before they decide it’s their duty to protect
the public from the truth,

Is the U.S. Government trying to compete with Bussia’s fascist
ways of suppression of free sreech and freedom of the press? It’s
ironic that at the same time the Smothers Brothers are fired Russia is
threatening Czechoslovakia with more troops if they don’t administer
self-censorship.

. It is our hope that another network wil] hire the Smothers Brothers
so they can continue to tell the truth next year. What will happen,
though, if this network does not bend under the Govt's. pressure? Will
the U.S. send occupying troops in?
