But that's the way things were meant, We've just got to try. It's all
we can do and then maybe there'll be a change for the good. If only we try.

Horrors 1969 part 2:
	
		the San Francisco Presidio (America's Devil's Island)
The inhumane treatment received by American soldiers in some military
stockades in the United States is beyond your imagination. We will give
you a few examples and let you react. 

		The stockades standard capacity is 88 men, with an
		emergency capacity of between 115 and 150. Under
		regulations this emergency capacity cannot be tolerated for more then 7 days. 
		The stockade has held an excess of 115 prisoners since August 22, 1968.

		Overflowing latrines spill human excrement on the
		floor, which has no drain.

		Prisoners are frequently forced to relieve themselves
		on the floor of their cells and their excrement or
		urine is allowed to remain on the cell floor for a
		considerable period of time.

		Prisoners in the segregation cells have been refused
		permission to brush their teeth, bathe, or change
		their clothes for periods up to a week.

		The heating in these cells is inadequate and to pun-
		ish recalcitrant prisoners, guards take the prisoner's
		clothes and blankets from him and throw water on his
		naked body, At times urine has been substituted for
		water.

		The average age of the prisoners is 19 to 20.

		Most prisoners are in on AWOL charges.

		Even if these men were hardened felons their treatment
		and living conditions would still constitute cruel
		and unusual punishment.
