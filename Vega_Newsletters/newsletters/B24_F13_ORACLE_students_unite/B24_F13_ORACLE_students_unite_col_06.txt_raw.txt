But that's the way things were meant, Welve just got to try, It's all
we can do and then maybe there'll be a change for the good, If only wetry.

Horrors 1969 part 2:
the San Francisco Presidio (America 's Devil's Island}
The inhumane treatment received by American soldiers in some military
stockades in the United States is beyond your imagination. We will give
you a few examples and let you react. z
The stockades standard capacity is 88 men, wit an
emergency capacity of between 115 end 150. Under
regulations this emercency capacity cannot be tolerat+
ed for more then 7 days. The stockade has held an ex-
cess of 115 prisoners since August 22, 1968.
Overflowing latrines spill human excrement on the ..-
floor, which has no drain,
Prisoners are frequently forced to relieve themselves
on the floor of their cells and their excrement or
urine is allowed to remain on the cell floor fora
considerable period of time,
Prisoners in the segregation celis have been refused
permission to brush their teeth, bathe, or change
their clothes for periods up to a week,
The heating in these cells.is inadequate and to pun-
ish recalcitrant prisoners, guerds takeâ€™ the prisoner's
clothes and blankets from him and throw water on his
naked body, At times urine has been substituted for
waters
The average age of the prisoners is 19 to 20.
Most prisoners are in on AWOL charges.
Even if these men were harden felons their treatment
: and living conditions would still constitute cruel
and unusual punishment.
