this new garb without knowing its implications. You who wear “bells"
and al] these “groovy‘ minies preserve a vacuum in your heads. Complete
apathy. You would rather talk about who had whom last night, who
is going with whom--etc. etc. etc. Gossip, nothing but GOSSIP. Who is
"Che"? Cleaver? Newton? Hayden? Rubens? Hoffman? Gregory? YOU DON'T KNOW!
These men are shaping this country, this world.

	Get off your asses and let your minds become AWARE.

				SMOTHERS BROTHERS CANCELLED

	The Smothers Brothers vs. CBS fight over taste and censorship has
ended. Friday, the Columbia Broadcasting System announced the cancellation of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour for next season. 

	The president of CBS-TV, Robert Wood, said the Smothers Brothers
had consistently failed to deliver tapes of the program to the network
in time for review by network executives and local stations.

	The real reason one of TV's favorite shows was dumped was because
the Smothers Brothers told the truth and CBS was afraid to show it, Another 
factor was the pressure exerted on TV networks by the Government
to self-censor their shows before they decide it’s their duty to protect
the public from the truth.

	Is the U.S. Government trying to compete with Russia’s fascist
ways of suppression of free speech and freedom of the press? It’s
ironic that at the same time the Smothers Brothers are fired Russia is
threatening Czechoslovakia with more troops if they don’t administer
self-censorship.

	It is our hope that another network will hire the Smothers Brothers
so they can continue to tell the truth next year. What will happen,
though, if this network does not bend under the Govt's. pressure? Will
the U.S. send occupying troops in?
