	In the past year many high school students have begun to realize what this world is like, the injustices inflicted on man by his own brothers. In growing aware, they have become active in denouncing their inadequate administrative heads. They want a voice in the forming of school policies. They are tired of puppet student governments.  The administration’s ignorance and stubbornness breed these revolts.

	Underground papers, like this and some more radical, have sprung from one part of this country to the other in high schools. Why? Dissatisfaction with the rules that try to regulate our lives, bodies, and souls; awareness of the malfunctioning courses and teachers that in no way serve our need of preparing us for the world; dress codes which have nothing to do with the institution's business-- education.

	This assault on the white power structure is being carried out from two fronts: the white radicals and revolutionaries coming from “middle" class families who are seeking a new mold of life, and the black militants who seek their share of the "good" life that this country's technological advancement can provide. Both parties have souls, and different factions within each movement might have different solutions for solving problems, but they both seek chance
and both are willing to fight and die for it.

	Most of the BLACK militants are together in their strive against “whitey". This is not true in the white radical movement. The blacks are full time revolutionaries while many whites are willing to throw a few bricks through windows then go home and listen to music. These whites must organize and join forces with the blacks.

	The trouble with this high school is that you people are not together. You don't care what is happening--you are plastic--you wear
