The United States of America 1s supposed
to be the richest and the most technilogical
advanced country in the history of man. You
might think with all the money and brains this |
country might find a wav to live in peace. If |
the leaders of this country wanted, they
could do it. In less than 2 decade, we have
reached the moon. Why? Because the leaders
gave the space programs large amounts of
money and an endless supply of technicians.

If the President really wanted to, he could
wipe out poverty at home, bring peacd here,
This country has not, in all its glory,
given up a trait of man as old as history.
A trait that has brought down empires that

were great in their time.
