Policemen are paranoic about being called pigs.
With the tretment they sometimes get, they be-
come vey suspicious-Iguess with reason. Yet
they commit the very same crime they resent in
others, and that is stereotyping people. When
thev see some one with long hair and a beard
he is automatically a hippie, a drug user, a
sex manic and so on. I think the police are go-
ing to have to put their own house in order.
In some parts of the country their reputation
has been well earned. We aré going to have to
open up the police department and get rid of
this "secret organization" concept. I think
they are going to have to de-militerize...in
their approach to problem solving.
