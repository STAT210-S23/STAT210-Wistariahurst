The Chinese drop bombs for peace. The Army is
for peace, the left wing goes around bombing
buildings for peace, but that is not how peace
comes. Peace is what you do with your daily
life, It means a total rearrangement of every-
ones own life style...The kids think they are
going to be able to isolate themselves. Leave
me alone,“I'l] find my own thing.” But ‘your own
thing’ is part of the brotherhood - the rest of
these few billion people...People are born hon-
est andthey trust. I thin’ this is born into us.
But it is difficult to take this road so they
choose other ways. It is much easier to shout
‘'Pigs!' and find an enemy. You never really con-
quer enemies. It's like fear-you don't get rid
of it. It's always there, but you can overcome
It. -Joan Baez Harris
