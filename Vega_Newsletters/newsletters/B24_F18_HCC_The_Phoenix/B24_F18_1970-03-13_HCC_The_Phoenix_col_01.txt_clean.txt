					Cultural Affairs Committee-Trials and Triumph

	The Cultural Affairs Committee of HCC conducted a poll late last semester. On the Ballot was various names of controversial speakers, most of them were men who dealt in politics and whose views expressed those of the left. The committee deduced that since the Attorney General of Massachusetts had come, and being a part of the establishment had attracted only a handful of students, that the students would want a speaker from the left. It must be made clear that the committee used the results of the poll as a basis from which they would work from. The committee would not have to contact the winner.
