people at HCC who had worked on
the Moritorium had been very opti-
mistiec about its success. They felt
that the students would really want
te work for the cause, but few
showed enough interest. As a result
the work load fell on a very small
group. “The majority of students
just didn’t seem to care enough.”
He also felt that the Moritorium
reached a climax too quickly with
the march on Washington, “Things
should have built up more slowly,
but I certainly don’t feel that the
anti-war movement is dead, just
dormant. There should be a renew-
alin the Spring.”
