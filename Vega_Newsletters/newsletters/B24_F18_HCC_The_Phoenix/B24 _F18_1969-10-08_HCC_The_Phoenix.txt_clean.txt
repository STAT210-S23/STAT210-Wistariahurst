			Undergrounder Joins Straight Phoenix Staff

	Carlos Vega, a freshman at HCC and member of the Phoenix staff, is editor of the newspaper Breakthru.
	Breakthru, originally the Holyoke High School underground paper called Free Purple, later called the Oracle, was founded at the high school, “Because of an infringement of freedom of speech by the high school administration.” If the high school administration did not agree with the official school paper, the Herald, they would censor it,” stated Vega.
	“Free Purple folded because students became tired of reading redundant articles. So I was asked to take over,” stated Vega.
	The paper is put out by a staff of seven people, all from Holyoke, and has a circulation
of about five hundred. “We received a letter from a student in New York and a congratulatory
letter from William Dwight, editor of the Holyoke Transcript,” Vega stated further, “but we still can’t sell Breakthru at Holyoke High; we have to sell it outside.”
	At the present time Breakthru is a small, four-page publication. “We hope to expand to six pages and instead of using sellers we would like to get the paper into different stores in the city. I hope to get it into [the] HCC bookstore,” Vega said.
	When asked why he joined the Phoenix staff if he had his own paper, Vega replied, “To do something for the school, I mean I’m here for two years. I have heard there is a lot of apathy here and I don’t want to be a part of it. Students can do a lot if they get together.”
