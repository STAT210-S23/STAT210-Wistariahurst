and knowing that the administration was against it, a committee member who felt that President
Frost was using stalling tactics, decided to contact the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU would take the course to court. Freedom of speech was involved, the Student Senate voted in favor of the ACLU taking the case.
	On Feb. 6, 1970 President Frost asked for a special Student Senate meeting. The Senate members showed great opposition to the stand Dr. Frost took. Frost wanted the Senate to reconsider their decision to bring Mr. Rubin to HCC.
	The meeting came to a compromise. Frost wanted the Senate to conduct a poll. He wanted at least 800 student names and approximately 30% of the faculty. Some senators felt that the faculty vote was not in order.
	The Senate conducted the “poll” and acquired app. 500 student signatures and 82 faculty signatures. Dr. Frost then signed the contract.
	The Committee has been wrestling with the acquisition of a place to hold the assembly. At the time of the signing of the contract they had been promised the Armory, they were later denied this.
