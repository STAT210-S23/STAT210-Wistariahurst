	Carlos Vega, a student at HCC, was also very active in the anti-war movements in this area. He has done some studying of the problem and has gone into its history in order to understand as much as possible about it. He feels the leaders must educate the people to what is happening, “If they have an understanding of the situation they can make more intelligent decisions.”
	In reply to the President’s “silent majority,” he feels it is a movement towards “putting the people into one class.” Mr. Vega also expressed the opinion that it is an attempt to “polarize the people into separate camps.” He felt that the withdrawal plan has succeeded in pacifying the people, but that effort is not really sincere, “While the President takes out troops on one side, he is also putting others back in.” Mr. Vega also pointed out that there has been no attempt to find a replacement for John Cabot Lodge at the Paris Peace Talks.
	Vega also commented that the people at HCC who had worked on the Moratorium had been very optimistic about its success. They felt that the students would really want to work for the cause, but few showed enough interest. As a result the workload fell on a very small
group. “The majority of students just didn’t seem to care enough.” He also felt that the Moratorium reached a climax too quickly with the march on Washington, “Things should have built up more slowly, but I certainly don’t feel that the anti-war movement is dead, just dormant. There should be a renewal in the Spring.”
