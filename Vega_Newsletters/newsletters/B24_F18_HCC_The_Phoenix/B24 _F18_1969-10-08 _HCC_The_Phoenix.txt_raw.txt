Undergrounder
Joins Straight
Phoenix Staff

Carlos Vega, a freshman at
HCC and member of the Phoenix
staff, is editor of the newspaper
Breakthru.

Breakthru, originally the
Holyoke High School under-
ground paper called Free Pur-
ple, later called the Oracle, was
founded at the high school, “Be-
cause of an infringement of
freedom of speech by the high
school administration.” If the
high school administration did
not agree with the official school
paper, the Herald, they would
censor it,” stated Vega.

“Free Purple folded because
students became tired of reading
redundant articles. So I was
asked to take over,” stated
Vega.

The paper is put out by a
staff of seven people, all from
Holyoke, and has a circulation
of about five hundred. “We re-
ceived a letter from a student in
New York anda congratulatory
letter from William Dwight,
editor of the Holyoke Tran-
script,” Vega stated further,
“but we still can’t sell Break-
thru at Holyoke High; we have
to sell it outside.”

At the present time Break-
thru is a small, four-page
publication. “We hope to ex-
pand to six pages and instead of
using sellers we would like to
get the paper into different
stores in the city. I hope to got
it into HCC bookstore,” Vega
said.

When asked why he joined the
Phoenix staff if he had his own
paper, Vega replied, “To do
something for the school, I mean
T’m here for two years. I have
heard there is a lot of apathy
here and I don’t want to be a
part of it. Students can do a
lot if they get together.”
