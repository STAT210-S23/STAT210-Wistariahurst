	Letters were sent to agents who could book the speakers, the committee then waited for replies.
	They received a call from the Conspiracy Office in Chicago in early Jan. The prices for their speakers were the lowest that the committee had found. So they contacted Jerry Rubin for Feb. 20. 1970.
	Members of the committee went to inquire about a place to hold the assembly. Dean Butler informed them that Mr. Scallon was the man in charge of booking the High School Auditorium. Butler also told them that the only person who could sign a contract was President Frost. He was of course wrong. He had signed contracts before.
	The committee members then went to President Frost. He, by that time had heard thru “the
grapevine” that the committee wanted Jerry Rubin. He was under the impression that “Only a very small part of the student body wanted him to speak. His answer was, NO!! I do not want that man here. He would disgrace the school.”
