	One of man's basic instincts is that of loving war. His life cannot continue without encountering a war. He is not content with peace for any long period of time. His most numerous quarrels center around: territorial disputes, hunger for wealth and power, fame, religion, and the most trivial, woman. A large percentage of today's nations have at one time experienced the utmost of prosperity and fame, As one nation flourished, its predecessor fell. Greece, Rome, Spain, England, France, and Germany all gained might and all recessed their position to their
successor.

	What did any of these nations gain? A few pages in a history book? Hatred? Praise? All these questions have numerous answers, but where is this feeling of conquest and wealth? They are old memories now, only used to stir the flakey hearts of the malcontented, brain-washed people. It is all over now. The fortune and fame of yesterday is all gone.

	We are not so idealistic to advocate an end to armies. There will always be rulers of countries who will seek fortune and fame. What we must do is to strengthen the United Nations, talk...solution and agreed plans are the only roads toward ending all wars.

murdered 6 million in the ovens they fried. The Germans now too
Have GOD ON THEIR SIDE"
