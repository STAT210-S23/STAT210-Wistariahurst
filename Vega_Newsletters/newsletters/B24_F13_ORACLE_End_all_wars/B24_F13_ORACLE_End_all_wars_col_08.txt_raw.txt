little joy
HK
Yet do not weep
stand up
tall,
erect !
For you
are proud ;
dignity filled,
put most of all

Modern Man's Appreciation of Beauty
bt tt
As I avoke one morning
When all sweet things are born
A robin perched upon my sill
To signal the coming morn
The bird was fragil, young and gay
So sweetly did it sing
That thoughts of joy and happiness
Within my heart did sing
It hummed a song so lovely
Then poised for a moments lull
T quickly pulled the window down
And crushed it's goddamn skull !
