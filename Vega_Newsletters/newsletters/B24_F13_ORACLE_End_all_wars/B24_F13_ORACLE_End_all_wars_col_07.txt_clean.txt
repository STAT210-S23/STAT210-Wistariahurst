	Black Woman

Beautiful, black woman
black and still as night;
Your eyes,
Throw out a blinding light
Hands,
That cannot be seen
covers and protects.
Your thighs,
gently,
softly rolling.
Bring forth,
you and him,
to carry on, 
your beautifulness.
	***
Beautiful, black woman
beautiful as a rose.
Your petals are
a new generation.
Your thorns,
not dangerous
but,
pain!
The pain
and struggle 
to be endured.
Your stem
sleek,
sensuous and
supple.
Is your beautiful
black body.
	***
Morning's dew
drip,
drip,
dripping, 
Are tears of anguish,
anguish from
years of pain
and so, so
