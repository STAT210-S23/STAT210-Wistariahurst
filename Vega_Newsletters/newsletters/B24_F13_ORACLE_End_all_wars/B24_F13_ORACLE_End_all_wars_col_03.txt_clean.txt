	and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood that
runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn.
You must say that I'm young
You must say I’m unlearned,
But there's one thing I know
I'm younger then you
And even Jesus would never forgive
	what you do.

Let me ask you one question.
Is your money that good;
Will it buy your forgiveness,
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made will never
	buy back your soul.

And I hope that you die.
And your death will come soon.

I'll follow your casket on a pale
	afternoon;
I'll watch while you're lowered,
Into your death bed.
And I°ll stand over your grave
	till I'm sure that your
	DEAD,
