. One of man's basic instincts is that of loving war. His life can
not continue without incountering a war. He is not content with peace
for any long period of time. His most numerous quarrels center around:
territorial disputes, hunger for wealth and power, fame, religion,
and the most trivial,voman, A large percentage of todays nations have
at one time experienced the utmost of posperity and fame, As one nation
flourished, its predecessor fell, Greece, Rome, Spain, England, France,
and Germany all gained might and all recessed their position to their
suceessor.

What did any of these nations gain? A few pages in a history book?
Hatred? Praise? All these questions heve numerous answers, But where
is this feeling of conquest and wealth? They are old memories now, only
used to stir the flakey hearts of the malcontented, brain-washed people
It is all over now, The fortune and fame of yesterday is all gone.

We are not so idealistic to advocate an end to armies. There will
always be rulers of countries who will seek fortune and fame, What we
must do is to strengthen the United Nations, talk,.,solution and a~
greed plans are the only roads to ward ending all vars.
