					Effect of Dress In School

	On Friday, Feb, 21, I went to a couple a classes at UMass– Comparative Literature 201 an 202. I really felt funny cuz I was like dressed in bell-bottom jeans, boots, an a grubby workshirt over a turtleneck, I was also chewin gum.

	The students there looked even better, though, cuz most of the guys had hair, beards, or mustaches. Some girls wore jeans an boots. The thing that really hit me, though, was that you could smoke in the lecture hall durin class. Even though you know you can, experiencin it is something different.

	Then the instructor, J.W. Deaver, walked in. He was wearin an open collared shirt an jeans! Of course we all realized that under these chaotic conditions we wouldn't be able to learn a thing so we all left.

	No, really, that was the way the lecture happened (excludin the
part about us splittin--that was sarcasm, folks). Here, they (the administration) think that if we ever came to class like that we'd spend all our time starin at each other, C'mon now! Nobody up there paid any attention to other people’s appearance, so why should we when the stupid dress code is abolished?

	OK now, they say it’s a distraction. To who? Not to the students
cuz they’re the ones who wanna look that way. To the teachers? All I can say is that if a student‘s appearance can hinder a teacher's ability to teach, he/she can’t be much of a teacher.

	C'mon now, people: Ya keep tellin us to grow up. Why don't you?

On Law and Order by John V,. Lindsay
…Shall we forget what history has always taught us: that those who suppress freedom always do so in the name of “law and order”?...

	We must never forget how this great country came all this way~how hard we have fought to achieve equal justice under the law, how long we have had to struggle to develop an order which protects individual rights and permits dissent. And we must never forget that we must go
on from here, that there is much work to be done.

	For if we forget, we will have security, and we will have order. What will be missing is liberty. What will be missing is the quality which sets the life of the free man so far above the life of the slave.
