Damn you Masters of War,
You that build the big guns,
You that build the death planes,
You that build all the bombs,
You that hide behind walls,
You that hide behind walls,
I just want you to know I can
	see through your masks.

You that never done nothing,
But build to destroy.
You play with my world,
Like itâ€™s your little toy.

You put a gun in my hand,
And you hide from my eyes.
And you turn and run faster when
	the fast bullets fly.

Like Judas of old you lie and
	deceive.
A World War can be won you want me
	to believe.
But I see through your eyes,
And I see through your brain like
I see through the water that runs
down my drain.

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch while
	the death count gets higher.
You hide in your mansion,
While young people's blood float
	out of their bodies and is
	buried in the mud.

You thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled,
Afraid to bring children into this
	world
Both threatening my baby, unborn
