little joy
	***
Yet do not weep
stand up
tall,
erect!
For you
are proud 
dignity filled,
but most of all
Black And Beautiful

Modern Man's Appreciation of Beauty
	+++++++++++++++++

As I awoke one morning
When all sweet things are born
A robin perched upon my sill
To signal the coming morn

The bird was fragile, young and gay
So sweetly did it sing
That thoughts of joy and happiness
Within my heart did sing

It hummed a song so lovely
Then poised for a moment's lull
I quickly pulled the window down
And crushed it's goddamn skull!
