Black Woman
Beautiful, black woman
E black and still as night;
Your eyes,
Throw out a blinding light
Hands,
That cannot be seen
covers and protects,
Your thighs,
gently,
softly rolling.
Bring forth,
you and him,
to carry on, Â°
your beautifulness.
REE
Beautiful, black woman
beautiful as a rose,
Your petals are
a new generation.
Your thornes,
not, dangerous
but,
pain!
The pain
and struggle .
to be endured,
Your stem
sleek,
sensuous and
supple.
Is your beautiful
black body.
RHE
Morning's dew
drip,
drip,
dripping, .
Are tears of anguish,
anguish from
years of pain
and so, so
