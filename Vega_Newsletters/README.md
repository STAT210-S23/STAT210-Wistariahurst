This is a folder which houses scans and curated materials from the Carlos Vega archive, specifically newsletters that he wrote, edited, and contributed to or that were written for organizations that he worked with.

See `raw_data` for unprocessed data, i.e. the original pdf scans sent over from Penni organized by newsletter name.

See `newsletter-catalog` for a condensed organized spreadsheet of all relevant newsletters organized by newsletter, date, issue number/title, and box/folder number according to the official finding aid.

See `newsletters` for all relevant newsletters organized into folders by issue. Each folder contains the original scanned newsletter.pdf, screenshots of the individual newsletter pages/columns according to the  the following structure: "B#_F#__NEWSLETTER_ISSUE_col_##.png", as well as the raw text versions of each page/column "B#_F#__NEWSLETTER_ISSUE_col_##.txt_raw" and the final, clean edited text versions denoted by "B#_F#__NEWSLETTER_ISSUE_col_##.txt_clean". The issue number and date, if known, are included in the file names for each newsletter.


13/17 of the newsletters of interest contain edited clean text files, while the remaining 5 newsletters contain the processed raw text files without edits. The first 14 newsletters are issues of _Oracle/Breakthru_, the underground newspaper that Vega co-founded and edited during and after his time at Holyoke High School. The remaining 3 newsletters consist of issues of _The Phoenix_, the student newspaper at Holyoke Community College that Vega contributed to from 1969-1971, as well as an English and Spanish translation of a 1984 issue of _The Community Builder_, the newsletter distributed by Vega's community development organization Nueva Esperanza.

See `report` for the final report containing example displays and text analysis of the archive (to be uploaded).

Special thanks to Penni and staff at Wistariahurst Museum for their gracious support and assistance with providing scanned copies of the original newsletters from the Carlos Vega Collection of Latino History in Holyoke.
