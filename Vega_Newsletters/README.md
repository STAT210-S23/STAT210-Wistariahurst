This is a folder which houses scans and curated materials from the Carlos Vega archive, specifically newsletters that he wrote, edited, and contributed to or that were written for organizations that he worked with.

See `raw_data` for unprocessed data, i.e. the original pdf scans sent over from Penni organized by newsletter name.

See `newsletters` for all relevant newsletters organized into folders by issue. Each folder contains the original scanned newsletter.pdf, screenshots of the individual newsletter pages/columns according to the  the following structure: "B#_F#__NEWSLETTER_ISSUE_col_##.png", as well as the raw text versions of each page/column "B#_F#__NEWSLETTER_ISSUE_col_##.txt_raw" and the final, clean edited text versions denoted by "B#_F#__NEWSLETTER_ISSUE_col_##.txt_clean". 12/17 of the newsletters contain edited clean text files, while the remaining 5 newsletters only contain the processed raw text files without edits.

See `report` for the final report containing example displays and text analysis of the archive (to be uploaded).

Special thanks to Penni and staff at Wistariahurst Museum for their gracious support and assistance with providing scanned copies of the original newsletters from the Carlos Vega Collection of Latino History in Holyoke.
